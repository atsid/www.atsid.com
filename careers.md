### ATS Culture
Get to know who we are - from the inside out. From our culture, to the people behind our products, we are a fun and interesting group of people who are constantly on the lookout for new solutions to problems. We have monthly happy hours and habitually lunch together when there’s time. We’re a very welcoming, inclusive group stemming from all backgrounds.

### Locations 
We have physical offices at the following locations, but don’t let that limit your interest. We allow teammates to work responsibly from their home offices depending on the client, contract and project manager. As long as you keep up attendance at meetings and communication with your teammates we are willing to work with you.
