The following is a position paper I put together for the ATS management team in late 2012. It was intended to introduce them to the idea of open source as something that we, as a for-profit company, could participate in.

We’ve come a long way in our embrace of the open source ethos, and some of the statements here feel out-dated (for example, we’re much more *lassiez-faire* about what we release than I expected). I love how this has taken off within the company, and it makes me happy that we’ve run with the best parts of what’s here, and ignored the bad parts.

In the interest of transparency, I’ve reproduced the paper nearly verbatim from the original, with only minor typo edits and removal of a couple of contract references.
