            <h4>Maintenance & Support Analysis</h4>
            <p>We bring disparate datasets together to develop a sustainable maintenance solution that improves supportability by identifying and fixing data problems; reduces delay-time by fixing part support problems by identifying parts that are about to fail or are failing; ensuring new parts are available when needed; and designing custom dashboards to monitor failure data to allow you to keep your finger on the pulse of the system.</p>

	        <h4>Configuration Data Management</h4>
	        <p>Through configuration management audits, validation, and verification, our Configuration Data Analysts and Specialists work with you to define user requirements to configure a product or item in such a way to ensure it works appropriately for its entire life cycle.  From initial configuration identification, to configuration control, followed by configuration accounting and auditing, we implement solutions for any product or item.  By doing so, the product or item is configured correctly, remains reliable, and empowers you and your team to make rapid corrections to issues when they arise.</p>
