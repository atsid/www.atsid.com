Her business model had stopped working, her brand was being stolen out from under her, and she owed $60,000 that she didnt have. A speaker, author, and New York Times-featured serial entrepreneur who had run successful companies for more than 30 years, Melodys world started disintegrating.\r\n\r\nAfter six months of anxiety, desperation, and struggling to change out of her pajamas in the morning, friends started getting worried. After a year, they started getting really worried. Finally, a friend asked, Melody, what do you love?\r\n\r\nMarshmallows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlashdance.\r\n\r\nThat was all it took.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarshmallow + Flashdance = ???\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the next several months, Melody started having serendipitous conversations that made her think maybe there was something to thisa way to take failure, marshmallows, and Flashdance and put them together to change the trajectory of her lifeto move herself forward by moving other women forward.\r\n\r\nShe started putting the wheels in motion for the first Urban Campfire  an event in Seattle where women could actually talk about their failures and work through them to move forward together. It included not only Flashdance and marshmallows, but friendship, food trucks, and a bunch of women who needed to be vulnerable with each other and move forward in their lives.\r\n\r\nThat was in August. After the event, the letters started pouring in.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory was made today in Seattle, in my soul, in my spirit and in my future. Thank you Urban Campfire for giving me exactly what I needed right now and for a day I will never forget. Bursting with joy, love of life and inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nUrban Campfire may have been one of the best nights of my life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo. Effing. Awesome.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy heart and spirit are light and inspired today after immersing myself in the power and beauty present at Urban Campfire yesterday. What a bunch of kickass women. Lets do it again!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nConnecting like this  real heartfelt conversations  is SO what Ive been wanting more of. Thank you SO much for dreaming. &lt;3 Laurie\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you so much for yesterdays amazing Urban Campfire event! I was so impressed with the physical layout and location, the organization throughout the day, the quality of the speakers, the food trucks and liquid libations, and the opportunity to sit in a circle with other women in vulnerable conversations. It was great to see such creativity and whole-heartedness present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEST EVENT EVER!!! xoxo Nicole\r\n\r\n\r\nIncredible. I feel so on fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat an exciting and totally life-changing event yesterday was. I loved every minute and the women in my groups shared from their hearts and told stories that were full of courage, vulnerability, and openness.\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday, I saw people all around me sitting there with that same sense of OH MY GOD. My life will be better forever because I was here today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen there were more letters. And more letters. Melody couldnt even look at them for two weeks because she was so overwhelmed by the response.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince then, word has spread, and weve had to figure out an answer to many questions, such as\r\n\r\nWhat now?\r\nHow do I keep this fire alive inside of me?\r\nHow can I share this with my friend who wasnt able to attend?\r\nHow can I meet more women like the ones who were at Urban Campfire?\r\nWhen do we get to do this again?\r\n\r\nIn response, we had an Urban Campfire Halloween event, which was amazing. Now were planning several winter events, in addition to the main Urban Campfire event to be held again in the summer of 2014. Were also putting together monthly CRAVE Fuel events in cities across the country. Were excited to get to have this amazing experience of connection and moving forward with more of you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut theres been something missing. When were not at an Urban Campfire event (and for people who havent been able to attend one at all), its hard to keep that fire going. Life-as-usual starts getting in the way, and we lose the vision that all these amazing women reflect back to us at Urban Campfire. We forget the talks weve heard (and if you didnt get to attend, you never got to hear them in the first place). We have good intentions of following through, but we know we could be doing so much more if Urban Campfire was ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow were getting to the (even better) part.\r\nIn response to this desire for ongoing inspiration and connection, we created a new kind of online experience called Urban Campout, for all the times when were not at an inspirational, life-changing event. Urban Campout is for you if you want to develop real friendships with amazing women while getting incredible inspiration and tools to move forward in your life. Its for you if youve been to Urban Campfire and want to experience it again, with more context, and worksheets and action steps to help you follow through.

Why so cheap, when other programs cost several hundred dollars a month, or thousands of dollars a year? Our answer: we want to give this experience to as many women as we can. We have a vision for connection, vulnerability, and forward movement happening across the country. To facilitate that, weve included two different tiers, so its easy to participate.\r\n\r\nIS IT EASY TO CANCEL MY MEMBERSHIP?\r\nAbsolutely. You can do it right from your dashboard.\r\n\r\nHOW OFTEN ARE NEW COURSES RELEASED?\r\nWe are curating our events all across the country to create actionable programs that can keep you connected and moving forward. This year, we plan on producing at least 6 original digital programs, with more to come all the time.\r\n\r\nWe are so thrilled to be able to connect and motivate each other (and ourselves!) in this new way. We hope youll join us as we make 2014 the best year ever.\r\n\r\nJOIN AS A REGULAR MEMBER ($35/month)\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nJOIN AS A PREMIUM MEMBER ($135/month)\r\n\r\nWeve got a spot saved for you, and we cant wait to see you there!','Home','','inherit','open','open','','5-revision-v1','','','2013-12-23 06:48:40','2013-12-23 06:48:40','',5,'http://dev.atsid.com/2013/12/23/5-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(16,3,'2013-12-23 06:49:34','2013-12-23 06:49:34','','Home','','inherit','open','open','','5-revision-v1','','','2013-12-23 06:49:34','2013-12-23 06:49:34','',5,'http://dev.atsid.com/2013/12/23/5-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(21,3,'2014-07-17 17:10:02','2014-07-17 17:10:02','<h2>Why Applied Technical Systems?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">Applied Technical Systems Inc.

The program was formally commissioned as a Navy-wide maintenance improvement effort. Leenstra decided to settle down in Washington with his family upon retirement after 23 years of enlisted and commissioned service. Leenstra was asked by a senior NAVSEA official coordinating the ILO efforts to continue implementing the ILO effort as a contractor. Leensstra agreed and formed ATS as a means to work with the Navy to fully implement the ILO program.</p>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_280\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/ADMJackWilliams_1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-280 size-thumbnail\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/ADMJackWilliams_1-150x142.jpg\" alt=\"ADMJackWilliams_1\" width=\"150\" height=\"142\" /></a> ADM Jack Williams, then Chief of Naval Material teaching COSAL[/caption]\r\n<h3>ATS legacy with Admiral J. G. Jack Williams, USN</h3>\r\n<p>Admiral Jack Williams graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946 and reported to a destroyer as Gun Boss. After completing submarine training he served on USS Pompodon (SS-486) and USS Stickelback (SS-415). He later commanded USS Sterlet (SS-392) and after nuclear power training commanded USS Haddo (SSN-604) and USS Daniel Webster (SSBN-626). After a tour as Director of Training for Naval Reactors, he assumed duties as Force Material Officer (N4) for Commander Submarine Forces, Atlantic. He then took command of Submarine Squadron 16 in Rota, Spain. Upon completion of that tour he was selected for Rear Admiral and subsequently served as Naval Attaché to the Turkish Navy. Later he commanded Submarine Group Five in San Diego. Upon promotion to Vice Admiral he served as Deputy Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet and then as Vice Chief of Naval Operations for Submarine Warfare. In 1981 he was promoted to Admiral and assigned duties as Chief of Naval Material. Admiral Williams retired from the Navy in 1983 and returned to his boyhood home in Illwaco, Washington.</p>\r\n<p>In 1984 he joined ATS as a director and eventually assumed the position of Chairman of the Board, which he held until his unexpected death in 1991. During this period Admiral Williams was instrumental in creating the Naval Undersea Museum in Keyport, served as President of the Northwest Chapter of the Naval Submarine League, and was a key player in helping ATS develop configuration-based lifecycle logistics support solutions for both submarines and surface ships.</p>\r\n<h3>A heritage in solving complex data problems</h3>\r\n<p>Several years before XML became a de facto standard, ATS realized the need for a hierarchical, self-describing, data modeling and storage technology. ATS developed the Contiguous Connection Model (CCM) technology to facilitate rapid information retrieval, enhance data navigation and visualization, and promote knowledge discovery.  This patented technology (US Patent #s 5,303,367 and 5,555,409), which was revolutionary for its time, automatically correlates hierarchical data, models it, and stores it in expandable name/value pairs.  CCM goes much furtherit creates a complete new hierarchical structure for each and every data point, with the data point as the root. These \"inversions\" are permanently stored and can be intuitively browsed using our powerful visualization tools.</p>\r\n<p>CCM was the pre-cursor to REGGAE, patented under  8,069,188 which is a core component of the ATS Cloud Analytical Platform.  REGGAE is an innovative cellular-like data model to describe and relate complex data structures, perform distributed data analytics and find similar data based on like connections and attributes. The invention in this latest patent provides a means to easily discover behaviors and patterns among seemingly unrelated data. For example, a retail store can easily analyze its customer behaviors to determine which products are more suitable for different demographics.  There are numerous applications in healthcare, evidence discovery, threat intelligence, etc.</p>','History','','publish','open','open','','history','','','2014-08-27 17:12:32','2014-08-27 17:12:32','',21,'http://dev.atsid.com/?page_id=72',1,'page','',0),(73,3,'2014-07-17 22:15:21','2014-07-17 22:15:21','','History','','inherit','open','open','','72-revision-v1','','','2014-07-17 22:15:21','2014-07-17 22:15:21','',72,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/17/72-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(74,3,'2014-07-17 22:16:34','2014-07-17 22:16:34','<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n<strong>Rick Leenstra, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</strong>\r\n\r\nSince founding ATS in 1980 upon his retirement from the US Navy, Rick has applied his extensive experience with configuration-based life cycle maintenance support systems for Naval ships and systems to the development of ATS\' technology and service offerings.  Rick is the co-inventor of ATS\' patented CCM technology.

ATS developed the Contiguous Connection Model (CCM) technology to facilitate rapid information retrieval, enhance data navigation and visualization, and promote knowledge discovery.  This patented technology (US Patent #s 5,303,367 and 5,555,409), which was revolutionary for its time, automatically correlates hierarchical data, models it, and stores it in expandable name/value pairs.  CCM goes much furtherit creates a complete new hierarchical structure for each and every data point, with the data point as the root. These \"inversions\" are permanently stored and can be intuitively browsed using our powerful visualization tools.\r\n\r\nThe third patent is for a Relational Generating Graph Analysis Engine (REGGAE). REGGAE has an innovative cellular-like data model used to describe and relate complex data structures, perform distributed data analytics and find similar data based on like connections and attributes. The patent was issued as US Patent No. 8,069,188.\r\n\r\nWhen asked to describe the value of the patent to ATS, co-author Bryan Tower stated, Since we applied for the patent in early 2008, ATS has implemented this engine in a variety of applications that need to analyze complex data relationships. In the intelligence community, we created an application called Hypergraph that uses the engine to perform distributed data analytics in a secure, private cloud computing environment. It enables analysts to quickly and easily perform multidimensional analysis on millions of text documents. The invention in this patent provides a means to discover behaviors and patterns among seemingly unrelated data. For example, a retail store can easily analyze its customer behaviors to determine which products are more suitable for different demographics. There are numerous applications in healthcare, evidence discovery, threat intelligence, and other areas.\r\n\r\nThe CCM technology is the pre-cursor to REGGAE, a core component of the <a href=\"http://atsid.com/solutions/it-solutions/data-analytics\">Arcus Cloud Analytical Platform</a>.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;','Patents','','publish','open','open','','patents','','','2014-08-27 17:12:51','2014-08-27 17:12:51','',21,'http://dev.atsid.com/?page_id=78',4,'page','',0),(79,3,'2014-07-17 22:16:49','2014-07-17 22:16:49','','Patents','','inherit','open','open','','78-revision-v1','','','2014-07-17 22:16:49','2014-07-17 22:16:49','',78,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/17/78-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(84,3,'2014-07-17 22:17:35','2014-07-17 22:17:35','<div>\r\n<p>Look for ATS at these upcoming Conferences &amp; Trade Shows.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Date</th>\r\n<th>Event</th>\r\n<th>Location</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>July 27, 2014</td>\r\n<td><a title=\"Whaling Days / Silverdale Rotary Duck Race\" href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/meet-ats/meetings-events/whaling-days-silverdale-rotary-duck-race/\">Whaling Days / Silverdale Rotary Duck Race</a></td>\r\n<td>Silverdale Waterfront ParkSilverdale WA 98383</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n','Meetings & Events','','publish','open','open','','meetings-events','','','2014-08-27 17:07:42','2014-08-27 17:07:42','',0,'http://dev.atsid.com/?page_id=84',16,'page','',0),(85,3,'2014-07-17 22:17:35','2014-07-17 22:17:35','','Meetings & Events','','inherit','open','open','','84-revision-v1','','','2014-07-17 22:17:35','2014-07-17 22:17:35','',84,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/17/84-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(87,3,'2014-07-17 22:18:22','2014-07-17 22:18:22',' ','','','publish','open','open','','87','','','2014-09-17 22:20:45','2014-09-17 22:20:45','',21,'http://dev.atsid.com/?p=87',3,'nav_menu_item','',0),(88,3,'2014-07-17 22:18:22','2014-07-17 22:18:22',' ','','','publish','open','open','','88','','','2014-09-17 22:20:45','2014-09-17 22:20:45','',21,'http://dev.atsid.com/?p=88',4,'nav_menu_item','',0),(89,3,'2014-07-17 22:18:22','2014-07-17 22:18:22',' ','','','publish','open','open','','89','','','2014-09-17 22:20:45','2014-09-17 22:20:45','',21,'http://dev.atsid.com/?p=89',5,'nav_menu_item','',0),(90,3,'2014-07-17 22:18:22','2014-07-17 22:18:22',' ','','','publish','open','open','','90','','','2014-09-17 22:20:45','2014-09-17 22:20:45','',21,'http://dev.atsid.com/?p=90',7,'nav_menu_item','',0),(93,3,'2014-07-17 22:21:10','2014-07-17 22:21:10','<h2>Why Applied Technical Systems?</h2>\r\n<img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"Why ATS?\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.comid.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/meet-ats-image.jpg\" width=\"415\" height=\"300\" />\r\n\r\nApplied Technical Systems Inc.

From the outset, our emphasis has been on finding ways to make the products of the Navys logistics lifecycle support system work for, rather than against, the shipboard maintenance technician.</span></h1>\r\n<div id=\"block-system-main\"><article id=\"node-basic-page-93\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nMost Operational Availability (Ao) and system sustainability problems experienced by the fleet today can be traced to a failure somewhere in the shore-based lifecycle logistics support system. Lack of onboard repair parts (OBRP) supply support is a particularly acute system sustainability problem, but there are also systemic problems with technical manuals, drawings, configuration and other types of engineering technical data. In many cases these technical data problems are the root cause of OBRP support problems, but they are often perceived as a Supply support problem.\r\n\r\nATS uses our unique product lifecycle maintenance solutions to troubleshoot and correct lifecycle integrated logistics support and sustainability problems. Most of our Maintenance Support Group technicians are former Navy technicians who have extensive experience in the operation and maintenance of the full spectrum of shipboard systems. This maintenance-oriented perspective is fundamental to our view of the integrated logistics support world and our maintenance support analysis processes.\r\n\r\nWe train our maintenance support technicians using our own in-house lifecycle support management training program which we developed from years of hands on experience in all facets of the integrated logistics support system. The end result is an experienced shipboard maintenance technician who is also trained to troubleshoot and repair any element of the Navys integrated logistics support system to make sure the ILS system provides our sailors with the parts, data and tools they need to restore failed systems with minimal delay.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" align=\"left\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">\r\n<h2>Maintenance &amp; Supportability Analysis</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<h2>Configuration Data Management (CDM)</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>ATS has provided preventative and corrective maintenance support solutions to its customers for over 30 years.

ATS developed the Contiguous Connection Model (CCM) technology to facilitate rapid information retrieval, enhance data navigation and visualization, and promote knowledge discovery.  This patented technology (US Patent #s 5,303,367 and 5,555,409), which was revolutionary for its time, automatically correlates hierarchical data, models it, and stores it in expandable name/value pairs.  CCM goes much furtherit creates a complete new hierarchical structure for each and every data point, with the data point as the root. These \"inversions\" are permanently stored and can be intuitively browsed using our powerful visualization tools.\n\nThe third patent is for a Relational Generating Graph Analysis Engine (REGGAE). REGGAE has an innovative cellular-like data model used to describe and relate complex data structures, perform distributed data analytics and find similar data based on like connections and attributes. The patent was issued as US Patent No. 8,069,188.\n\nWhen asked to describe the value of the patent to ATS, co-author Bryan Tower stated, Since we applied for the patent in early 2008, ATS has implemented this engine in a variety of applications that need to analyze complex data relationships. In the intelligence community, we created an application called Hypergraph that uses the engine to perform distributed data analytics in a secure, private cloud computing environment. It enables analysts to quickly and easily perform multidimensional analysis on millions of text documents. The invention in this patent provides a means to discover behaviors and patterns among seemingly unrelated data. For example, a retail store can easily analyze its customer behaviors to determine which products are more suitable for different demographics. There are numerous applications in healthcare, evidence discovery, threat intelligence, and other areas.\n\nThe CCM technology is the pre-cursor to REGGAE, a core component of the <a href=\"http://atsid.com/solutions/it-solutions/data-analytics\">Arcus Cloud Analytical Platform</a>.\n\n</div>\n&nbsp;','Patents','','inherit','open','open','','78-autosave-v1','','','2014-07-18 20:28:51','2014-07-18 20:28:51','',78,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/18/78-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(133,3,'2014-07-18 04:02:04','2014-07-18 04:02:04','<table border=\"1\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=5,303,367.PN.&amp;OS=PN/8,069,188&amp;RS=PN/8,069,188\" target=\"_blank\">5,303,367</a></td>\r\n<td>Computer driven systems and methods for managing data which use two generic data elements and a single ordered file</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=5,555,409.PN.&amp;OS=PN/8,069,188&amp;RS=PN/8,069,188\" target=\"_blank\">5,555,409</a></td>\r\n<td>Data management systems and methods including creation of composite views of data</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=8,069,188.PN.&amp;OS=PN/8,069,188&amp;RS=PN/8,069,188\" target=\"_blank\">8,069,188</a></td>\r\n<td>Database system storing a data structure that includes data nodes connected by context nodes and related method</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<div><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.atsid.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/Virtualworld-sm.jpg\" width=\"218\" height=\"145\" />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<h3>A heritage in solving complex data problems</h3>\r\nSeveral years before XML became a de facto standard, ATS realized the need for a hierarchical, self-describing, data modeling and storage technology.

The solution must be capable of handling petabyte-scale data sets with unique security requirements.  While the conventional relational model of data has been a mainstay of IT systems for almost 40 years, the volume and velocity of data that organizations are now collecting and storing have strained these traditional systems to their breaking point. Enterprises are now looking for alternatives that address users needs to quickly retrieve high fidelity answers to their analytical questions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">This is a fantastic win that builds on ATS rich history in working with complex, inter-connected datasets at scale, said Ken Smith, ATS Chief Scientist. ATS designed and developed what could be considered one of the earliest associative or graph databases over 20 years ago with the introduction of our Contiguous Connection Model (CCM). I am excited at this opportunity to build on that legacy and develop a substantially more scalable and secure datastore that preserves all the power and expressivity of a relationship-focused model.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">Founded in 1980, ATS is a leader in software, services and solutions that help the government and businesses transform data to decisions.  Headquartered in Silverdale, Washington, ATS also has offices in Alexandria, Virginia and Suffolk, Virginia.</p>','SBIR Award for ATS to develop a Scalable, Secure Associative Database','','publish','open','open','','sbir-award-for-ats-to-develop-a-scalable-secure-associative-database','','','2014-07-18 18:17:19','2014-07-18 18:17:19','',0,'http://dev.atsid.com/?p=147',0,'post','',0),(148,3,'2014-07-18 18:27:49','2014-07-18 18:27:49','<aside class=\"alignright\">\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_386\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"213\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/1.Analysis-1.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-386 size-full\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/1.Analysis.gif\" alt=\"Configuration Item Sight Validation\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /></a> Configuration Item Sight Validation[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_387\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"213\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/2.CI-TI_modeling-1.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-387 size-full\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/2.CI-TI_modeling.gif\" alt=\"CI-TI Data Modeling\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /></a> CI-TI Data Modeling[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_388\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"213\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/3.graph-viewer-1.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-388 size-full\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/3.graph-viewer.gif\" alt=\"Visualization of CI-TI connections\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /></a> Visualization of CI-TI connections[/caption]\r\n\r\n</aside>Maintenance of US Navy shipboard systems is fundamentally a process of identifying what part failed (or is about to fail) and then replacing it. Analysis of ship-generated 3M maintenance actions consistently shows that on average 2/3 of all maintenance actions involve replacement of failed parts. If the required parts are available from shipboard stocks, the system is usually quickly restored. If the parts are not available, the equipment/system will be down or degraded until the parts are received from off-ship sources.\r\n\r\nThe ready availability of onboard repair parts (OBRP) is clearly one of the most critical factors in operational readiness. But, despite its importance, serious OBRP availability problems continue to plague the fleet. For over 40 years the Navy has been tracking OBRP effectiveness data through the 3M system. The data shows that, on average, 50% of the time that a technician needs a replacement part, it will not be available from shipboard supply. The numbers are a little better for submarines and a little worse for aircraft carriers, but the 50% number has held steady for years, and in fact is getting worse. What this means is that 50% of the time a technician needs a part, it has to be ordered from off-ship sourceswhich GAO and other studies show takes an average of 18 days. Again, this means the system will stay down or degraded until the part comes in, and that kind of logistics delay time has a dramatic affect on operational readiness. It is also the source of much frustration for shipboard sailors since there is little they can do about the problem. Poor parts support is a major contributor to the loss of organic maintenance capabilityas highlighted in the Balisle report of Surface Force Readiness.\r\n\r\nAlthough the lack of OBRP support is typically viewed as a supply problem, the underlying cause of these problems is often rooted in an engineering or maintenance data problem which manifests itself as a supply problem. OBRP requirements are defined and driven by the Coordinated Shipboard Allowance List (COSAL) process. In short, the COSAL is the machine that puts parts onboard for all other machinesand like any other machine if it fails to function it needs to be trouble shot and fixed. The COSAL is driven by system configuration data maintained by the In-service Engineering Agents (ISEA) in the Configuration Data Manager Database. Repair part maintenance requirements and repair philosophy are developed during the equipment acquisition and provisioning process and encoded into the constituent Allowance Parts Lists (APLs), also by the ISEAs. This data in turn plays a big part in the allowance calculation process, which defines which parts will be carried in ship supplyand any errors in this engineering/maintenance data will typically translate into OBRP support problems.\r\n\r\nThe CNO minimum requirement for COSAL OBRP effectiveness is 65%. But even that relatively low expectation has never been achieved, except for special interest systems that have their own support system. There have been a number of studies and analyses conducted by the GAO and others over the years that address this problem. These studies show that there are serious systemic problems that in combination contribute to the poor parts availability situation in the fleet. Salient systemic problems include:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Incomplete and inaccurate system configuration data for shipboard systems.</li>\r\n	<li>Incomplete and inaccurate maintenance and supply support data on equipment Allowance Parts Lists (APLs)</li>\r\n	<li>Problems with repair part sparing models (Policy)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nFor over 30 years, ATS has been working to isolate and solve (or at least alleviate) OBRP support problems for the Navy. These efforts include development and implementation of several major ILS/OBRP improvement efforts. These include the Integrated Logistics Overhaul (ILO) program; the Integrated Shipboard Maintenance Support (ISMS) training program; the aircraft carrier Maintenance Support Center (MSC) program, and the submarine Enhanced Integrated Logistics Overhaul (E-ILO) program. These and other efforts were aimed at finding ways to better integrate engineering, maintenance, and logistics support data and products through a common configuration connection. It is no secret that the Navys integrated logistics support processes and products are anything but integrated. The shore-based system is a convoluted collection of organizations and activities, each focused on its particular piece of the logistics puzzle with little integration of data or effort. Engineering data is maintained in one database, maintenance data in another, and supply data in yet anotherand the list goes on. All of these lifecycle support functions are configuration-dependent, yet none operate from a common definition of the configuration items (CI) that collectively constitute ship systems. Consequently, all are generally out of sync with actual system configuration, and with each other. The end result is poor onboard logistics support, particularly parts.\r\n\r\nOur experience has shown that it is difficult to identify problems with any particular element of logistics in isolation of all other elements, and of course system configuration data. For example, one cant look at an APL and determine that the maintenance coding for a particular part is wrong just by looking at it. However, when the APL data is married to IETM data that tells a sailor how to replace the part but the APL maintenance coding (SM&amp;R) says its a depot remove and replace part only, this inconsistency becomes immediately apparent. When this same data is further connected to actual maintenance failures for a particular system, one begins to see inconsistencies between what the sailor is actually doing, what the TM says to do, and what the maintenance philosophy encoded in the APL says to do. These are not isolated problems; they are common and completely predictable given the nature of the independent nature of the shore-based systems that produce them.\r\n\r\nIn order to deal with the underlying data integration problem, ATS has developed a unique data connection and correlation system that allows us to download system engineering, maintenance and logistics support data which is linked to a common configuration item (CI). Called the Maintenance &amp; Supportability Analysis Tool (MSAT), this tool supports data ingestion and integration from any source database and connects it all in such a way that discrepancies become immediately visible. The system was recently tested on a radar system, with alarming results. The system showed major discrepancies between engineering drawing BOM data and the IETM. For example, there were hundreds of parts listed in the IETM that do not connect to either the BOM or the APL. Moreover, there were hundreds of parts listed on the APL that did not connect back to the IETM or the BOM. Several hundred fleet maintenance items were analyzed and linked to the CI. Most of these involved replacement of repair parts, and only 4% were satisfied from onboard stock. Further analysis showed that the majority of these would never be allowed because the APL had them coded for intermediate or depot level maintenance only, which although clearly incorrect automatically prevented these items from even being considered for OBRP allowance. This was true even for Preventive Maintenance (PM) items identified on the Maintenance Requirement Cards (MRC).\r\n\r\nThese are just a few examples of the types of engineering, maintenance, and logistics support data disconnects that MSAT reveals. It is interesting to note that for this one radar system, there were about 65,000 entities that collectively described the system, its engineering drawings, specifications, IETM parts list, maintenance actions, APLs, and so on. Using its unique data connection process, MSAT automatically created over 1.25 million connections among these data. These connections (or lack of connections) can then be used by SMEs to analyze all maintenance actions and to flush out and fix the root cause of OBRP and many other support problems.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-157\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/maint-support-img3_0-300x200.png\" alt=\"maint-support-img3_0\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />\r\n\r\nMSAT is currently being used to analyze and correct maintenance support and sustainability problems for other shipboard systems.\r\n\r\nFor more information about MSAT, or to schedule a demo, please contact our Maintenance Support Group.','Maintenance Support in the US Navy','','publish','open','open','','maintenance-support-in-the-us-navy','','','2014-07-21 18:53:43','2014-07-21 18:53:43','',139,'http://dev.atsid.com/?page_id=148',0,'page','',0),(149,3,'2014-07-18 18:17:19','2014-07-18 18:17:19','<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Alexandria, VA - August 27, 2013 </strong> Applied Technical Systems was recently notified of its status as a successful offeror under the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program for their proposal to develop a Scalable, Secure Associative Database for the Office of Naval Research.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">In its proposed approach, ATS describes the design and development of a distributed associative database that would be built using open, non-proprietary industry standards.

Analysis of ship-generated 3M maintenance actions consistently shows that on average 2/3 of all maintenance actions involve replacement of failed parts. If the required parts are available from shipboard stocks, the system is usually quickly restored. If the parts are not available, the equipment/system will be down or degraded until the parts are received from off-ship sources.\r\n\r\nThe ready availability of onboard repair parts (OBRP) is clearly one of the most critical factors in operational readiness. But, despite its importance, serious OBRP availability problems continue to plague the fleet. For over 40 years the Navy has been tracking OBRP effectiveness data through the 3M system. The data shows that, on average, 50% of the time that a technician needs a replacement part, it will not be available from shipboard supply. The numbers are a little better for submarines and a little worse for aircraft carriers, but the 50% number has held steady for years, and in fact is getting worse. What this means is that 50% of the time a technician needs a part, it has to be ordered from off-ship sourceswhich GAO and other studies show takes an average of 18 days. Again, this means the system will stay down or degraded until the part comes in, and that kind of logistics delay time has a dramatic affect on operational readiness. It is also the source of much frustration for shipboard sailors since there is little they can do about the problem. Poor parts support is a major contributor to the loss of organic maintenance capabilityas highlighted in the Balisle report of Surface Force Readiness.\r\nAlthough the lack of OBRP support is typically viewed as a supply problem, the underlying cause of these problems is often rooted in an engineering or maintenance data problem which manifests itself as a supply problem. OBRP requirements are defined and driven by the Coordinated Shipboard Allowance List (COSAL) process. In short, the COSAL is the machine that puts parts onboard for all other machinesand like any other machine if it fails to function it needs to be trouble shot and fixed. The COSAL is driven by system configuration data maintained by the In-service Engineering Agents (ISEA) in the Configuration Data Manager Database. Repair part maintenance requirements and repair philosophy are developed during the equipment acquisition and provisioning process and encoded into the constituent Allowance Parts Lists (APLs), also by the ISEAs. This data in turn plays a big part in the allowance calculation process, which defines which parts will be carried in ship supplyand any errors in this engineering/maintenance data will typically translate into OBRP support problems.\r\n\r\nThe CNO minimum requirement for COSAL OBRP effectiveness is 65%. But even that relatively low expectation has never been achieved, except for special interest systems that have their own support system. There have been a number of studies and analyses conducted by the GAO and others over the years that address this problem. These studies show that there are serious systemic problems that in combination contribute to the poor parts availability situation in the fleet. Salient systemic problems include:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Incomplete and inaccurate system configuration data for shipboard systems.</li>\r\n	<li>Incomplete and inaccurate maintenance and supply support data on equipment Allowance Parts Lists (APLs)</li>\r\n	<li>Problems with repair part sparing models (Policy)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nFor over 30 years, ATS has been working to isolate and solve (or at least alleviate) OBRP support problems for the Navy. These efforts include development and implementation of several major ILS/OBRP improvement efforts. These include the Integrated Logistics Overhaul (ILO) program; the Integrated Shipboard Maintenance Support (ISMS) training program; the aircraft carrier Maintenance Support Center (MSC) program, and the submarine Enhanced Integrated Logistics Overhaul (E-ILO) program. These and other efforts were aimed at finding ways to better integrate engineering, maintenance, and logistics support data and products through a common configuration connection. It is no secret that the Navys integrated logistics support processes and products are anything but integrated. The shore-based system is a convoluted collection of organizations and activities, each focused on its particular piece of the logistics puzzle with little integration of data or effort. Engineering data is maintained in one database, maintenance data in another, and supply data in yet anotherand the list goes on. All of these lifecycle support functions are configuration-dependent, yet none operate from a common definition of the configuration items (CI) that collectively constitute ship systems. Consequently, all are generally out of sync with actual system configuration, and with each other. The end result is poor onboard logistics support, particularly parts.\r\n\r\nOur experience has shown that it is difficult to identify problems with any particular element of logistics in isolation of all other elements, and of course system configuration data. For example, one cant look at an APL and determine that the maintenance coding for a particular part is wrong just by looking at it. However, when the APL data is married to IETM data that tells a sailor how to replace the part but the APL maintenance coding (SM&amp;R) says its a depot remove and replace part only, this inconsistency becomes immediately apparent. When this same data is further connected to actual maintenance failures for a particular system, one begins to see inconsistencies between what the sailor is actually doing, what the TM says to do, and what the maintenance philosophy encoded in the APL says to do. These are not isolated problems; they are common and completely predictable given the nature of the independent nature of the shore-based systems that produce them.\r\n\r\nIn order to deal with the underlying data integration problem, ATS has developed a unique data connection and correlation system that allows us to download system engineering, maintenance and logistics support data which is linked to a common configuration item (CI). Called the Maintenance &amp; Supportability Analysis Tool (MSAT), this tool supports data ingestion and integration from any source database and connects it all in such a way that discrepancies become immediately visible. The system was recently tested on a radar system, with alarming results. The system showed major discrepancies between engineering drawing BOM data and the IETM. For example, there were hundreds of parts listed in the IETM that do not connect to either the BOM or the APL. Moreover, there were hundreds of parts listed on the APL that did not connect back to the IETM or the BOM. Several hundred fleet maintenance items were analyzed and linked to the CI. Most of these involved replacement of repair parts, and only 4% were satisfied from onboard stock. Further analysis showed that the majority of these would never be allowed because the APL had them coded for intermediate or depot level maintenance only, which although clearly incorrect automatically prevented these items from even being considered for OBRP allowance. This was true even for Preventive Maintenance (PM) items identified on the Maintenance Requirement Cards (MRC).\r\n\r\nThese are just a few examples of the types of engineering, maintenance, and logistics support data disconnects that MSAT reveals. It is interesting to note that for this one radar system, there were about 65,000 entities that collectively described the system, its engineering drawings, specifications, IETM parts list, maintenance actions, APLs, and so on. Using its unique data connection process, MSAT automatically created over 1.25 million connections among these data. These connections (or lack of connections) can then be used by SMEs to analyze all maintenance actions and to flush out and fix the root cause of OBRP and many other support problems.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-157\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/maint-support-img3_0-300x200.png\" alt=\"maint-support-img3_0\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />\r\n\r\nMSAT is currently being used to analyze and correct maintenance support and sustainability problems for other shipboard systems.\r\n\r\nFor more information about MSAT, or to schedule a demo, please contact our Maintenance Support Group.','Maintenance Support in the US Navy','','inherit','open','open','','148-revision-v1','','','2014-07-18 18:27:49','2014-07-18 18:27:49','',148,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/18/148-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(160,3,'2012-07-18 18:27:50','2012-07-18 18:27:50','<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\r\n<div class=\"field-items\">\r\n<div class=\"field-item even\">\r\n<h3>California Utility selects ATS to deliver a Learning Management System to improve operator readiness</h3>\r\n<strong>Silverdale, Wash. - July 18, 2012</strong> - Applied Technical Systems (ATS) announces today that a large California utility has awarded them a new software development contract aimed at improving operator training, remediation and overall crew readiness.\r\n\r\nATS will leverage widely available software to deliver a web-based solution for its over 200 plant operators.

Patent examiners are highly trained engineers with expertise in the subject area to which they are assigned. Unfortunately, the tools these examiners use for their investigations are an accumulation of disparate legacy software applications developed over the last 20 years. To make matters worse, these applications were not developed with any user interface consistency or thought toward maximizing efficiency. This results in a slow, error-prone process that diverts attention from the most important element of their job  making decisions on patentability. The process is so slow that the current patent backlog is nearing 700,000 applications, with only 6,800 examiners to evaluate them. Average time to grant a patent now sits at around 33 months from first submittal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The individuals evaluating patentability of the newest cutting edge technology are doing so with 20-year-old software applications and processes that can\'t keep up with the pace of innovation.</h3>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">Research has shown that information workers are most productive when the tools they use are so streamlined that they can get into a state of \"flow\"  a level of mental efficiency that allows full cognitive focus on the task, with minimal disruption from tools (such as error dialogs or hunting for obscure commands). Considering the number of patent applications submitted per week in the United States (approximately 5,000), patent examiners simply don\'t have the time to spend dealing with legacy systems. Their ability to enter a highly efficient work/thought mode for patent investigation is critical to manage such a high number of new applications.  In turn, more efficient patent processing will reduce the extreme costs (both financial and competitive) for entities seeking to protect intellectual property quickly and beat competitors to market.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">In order to help USPTO solve these problems, ATS is deploying a multi-faceted approach aimed at modernizing patent processing systems and keeping them compatible for future scalability.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>User-centered Design</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">Most importantly, ATS and partner Design for Context are building the new examination toolkit with user needs first. All interface designs are based on extensive examiner interviews and prototyping to evaluate the level of learnability, efficiency, and memorability. All application functionality, even the database modeling, is driven by front-end user needs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>Unified Toolkit</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">The tools examiners currently use consist of numerous standalone desktop applications. ATS is moving these tools into dynamic web applications with a unified interface. This will provide the ability to move data between tools seamlessly and take advantage of server-side processes to remember tasks, correlate data elements, and pre-fill data where needed   all of which were previously paper-based processes. A web-based environment also dramatically reduces deployment and maintenance costs for the Office of CIO.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>Service-oriented Architecture</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">A distributed, service-oriented architecture is utilized on the backend, in order to enable high scalability and interoperability of systems. This will allow new subsystems to be implemented as needed and connected to existing components using standards-based interfaces. The architecture also allows additional servers to be brought online easily, expanding the user and data load capacity seamlessly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>Agile Development</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">ATS engineers are experts at agile software development processes, and the USPTO has decided to use this approach for the development of the patent examiner toolkit. This leads to much lower cycle time, resulting in quicker feedback from users. The end result is a system that can be changed more readily to suit new information, such as additional data sources, without needing to re-architect the entire system using a months-long process. New directions and requirements from the client can be absorbed with minimal pain, and ATS can deliver the right development units at the right time.</p>\r\n&nbsp;','USPTO Patents End-to-End','','publish','open','open','','uspto-patents-end-to-end','','','2014-07-21 18:56:06','2014-07-21 18:56:06','',139,'http://dev.atsid.com/?page_id=162',0,'page','',0),(163,3,'2014-07-18 18:29:07','2014-07-18 18:29:07','<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\r\n<div class=\"field-items\">\r\n<div class=\"field-item even\">\r\n<h3>California Utility selects ATS to deliver a Learning Management System to improve operator readiness</h3>\r\n<strong>Silverdale, Wash. - July 18, 2012</strong> - Applied Technical Systems (ATS) announces today that a large California utility has awarded them a new software development contract aimed at improving operator training, remediation and overall crew readiness.\r\n\r\nATS will leverage widely available software to deliver a web-based solution for its over 200 plant operators.

Patent examiners are highly trained engineers with expertise in the subject area to which they are assigned. Unfortunately, the tools these examiners use for their investigations are an accumulation of disparate legacy software applications developed over the last 20 years. To make matters worse, these applications were not developed with any user interface consistency or thought toward maximizing efficiency. This results in a slow, error-prone process that diverts attention from the most important element of their job  making decisions on patentability. The process is so slow that the current patent backlog is nearing 700,000 applications, with only 6,800 examiners to evaluate them. Average time to grant a patent now sits at around 33 months from first submittal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The individuals evaluating patentability of the newest cutting edge technology are doing so with 20-year-old software applications and processes that can\'t keep up with the pace of innovation.</h3>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">Research has shown that information workers are most productive when the tools they use are so streamlined that they can get into a state of \"flow\"  a level of mental efficiency that allows full cognitive focus on the task, with minimal disruption from tools (such as error dialogs or hunting for obscure commands). Considering the number of patent applications submitted per week in the United States (approximately 5,000), patent examiners simply don\'t have the time to spend dealing with legacy systems. Their ability to enter a highly efficient work/thought mode for patent investigation is critical to manage such a high number of new applications.  In turn, more efficient patent processing will reduce the extreme costs (both financial and competitive) for entities seeking to protect intellectual property quickly and beat competitors to market.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">In order to help USPTO solve these problems, ATS is deploying a multi-faceted approach aimed at modernizing patent processing systems and keeping them compatible for future scalability.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>User-centered Design</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">Most importantly, ATS and partner Design for Context are building the new examination toolkit with user needs first. All interface designs are based on extensive examiner interviews and prototyping to evaluate the level of learnability, efficiency, and memorability. All application functionality, even the database modeling, is driven by front-end user needs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>Unified Toolkit</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">The tools examiners currently use consist of numerous standalone desktop applications. ATS is moving these tools into dynamic web applications with a unified interface. This will provide the ability to move data between tools seamlessly and take advantage of server-side processes to remember tasks, correlate data elements, and pre-fill data where needed   all of which were previously paper-based processes. A web-based environment also dramatically reduces deployment and maintenance costs for the Office of CIO.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>Service-oriented Architecture</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">A distributed, service-oriented architecture is utilized on the backend, in order to enable high scalability and interoperability of systems. This will allow new subsystems to be implemented as needed and connected to existing components using standards-based interfaces. The architecture also allows additional servers to be brought online easily, expanding the user and data load capacity seamlessly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>Agile Development</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">ATS engineers are experts at agile software development processes, and the USPTO has decided to use this approach for the development of the patent examiner toolkit. This leads to much lower cycle time, resulting in quicker feedback from users. The end result is a system that can be changed more readily to suit new information, such as additional data sources, without needing to re-architect the entire system using a months-long process. New directions and requirements from the client can be absorbed with minimal pain, and ATS can deliver the right development units at the right time.</p>\r\n&nbsp;','USPTO Patents End-to-End','','inherit','open','open','','162-revision-v1','','','2014-07-18 18:29:59','2014-07-18 18:29:59','',162,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/18/162-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(166,3,'2014-07-18 18:31:05','2014-07-18 18:31:05','<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden clearfix\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\r\n<div class=\"field-items\">\r\n<div class=\"field-item even\">\r\n\r\n<strong>Silverdale</strong><strong>, Wash. </strong><strong>- May 15, 2012</strong>  Applied Technical Systems, a provider of data-to-decision technology and services, unveils its new website today to better connect with its growing customer base.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to simplify the complex nature of our patented technologies and broad base of data services, we are thrilled to launch a brand new website, said Ed Hallda, VP of Strategic Development at ATS, Our recent string of successes in the federal and defense markets are indicative of the confidence our customers have placed in ATS.  We believe this website will become an information hub that better serves our customers and partners.\r\n\r\nLaunching under a new web address, DataToDecisions.com, visitors will be provided insight into its latest technology projects, patents and case studies.  The new website is tightly integrated with its recruiting technology to automatically post its latest job openings on its website and capture job applications.\r\n\r\nWe have experienced significant growth these past 18 months, said Carey Kolb, VP at ATS, To maintain this pace, we needed a broad-based approach to attract and recruit the best talent.\r\n\r\nThe new website comes along with an update to the ATS logo, social networking, a historical timeline of the companys 32-year evolution, insight into its patents and latest technologies as well as an up to date calendar of events.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1980, ATS is a leader in software, services and solutions that help the government and businesses transform data to decisions.  Headquartered in Silverdale, Washington, ATS also has offices in Alexandria, Virginia and Suffolk, Virginia.\r\n\r\nFor more information about ATS, visit <a class=\"ext\" style=\"color: #8a2216;\" href=\"http://www.datatodecisions.com/\">www.DataToDecisions.com</a> or call 360.698.7100.\r\n\r\n<b>Media Contact:</b>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-contact-name field-type-text field-label-hidden clearfix\" style=\"font-weight: bold;

From the outset, our emphasis has been on finding ways to make the products of the Navys logistics lifecycle support system work for, rather than against, the shipboard maintenance technician.\r\n\r\nMost Operational Availability (Ao) and system sustainability problems experienced by the fleet today can be traced to a failure somewhere in the shore-based lifecycle logistics support system. Lack of onboard repair parts (OBRP) supply support is a particularly acute system sustainability problem, but there are also systemic problems with technical manuals, drawings, configuration and other types of engineering technical data. In many cases these technical data problems are the root cause of OBRP support problems, but they are often perceived as a Supply support problem.\r\n\r\nATS uses our unique product lifecycle maintenance solutions to troubleshoot and correct lifecycle integrated logistics support and sustainability problems. Most of our Maintenance Support Group technicians are former Navy technicians who have extensive experience in the operation and maintenance of the full spectrum of shipboard systems. This maintenance-oriented perspective is fundamental to our view of the integrated logistics support world and our maintenance support analysis processes.\r\n\r\nWe train our maintenance support technicians using our own in-house lifecycle support management training program which we developed from years of hands on experience in all facets of the integrated logistics support system. The end result is an experienced shipboard maintenance technician who is also trained to troubleshoot and repair any element of the Navys integrated logistics support system to make sure the ILS system provides our sailors with the parts, data and tools they need to restore failed systems with minimal delay.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" align=\"left\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">\r\n<h2>Maintenance &amp; Supportability Analysis</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<h2>Configuration Data Management (CDM)</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>ATS has provided preventative and corrective maintenance support solutions to its customers for over 30 years.

ATS is the first company that can show technical data errors between relevant engineering, maintenance and logistics data and provide its customers with a maintenance sustainment solution that corrects this systemic data integration problemfrom the deck-plate to the SYSCOM level.</p>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_285\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"213\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/msc1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-285 size-full\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/msc1.png\" alt=\"Maintenance Support Center Data Analysis\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /></a> Maintenance Support Center Data Analysis[/caption]\r\n\r\n<p>Too often there are serious problems with maintenance support, particularly onboard repair parts, but the root cause of these problems is seldom evident to shipboard techniciansthey just learn to live with them. Our technicians, however, are specially trained to troubleshoot and fix these logistics support system problems in much the same way as shipboard technicians are trained to troubleshoot and fix shipboard system problems.

MSAT has the capability to ingest any type of engineering, maintenance and logistics support data down to the piece part level in order to automatically expose and eliminate the data disconnects that create or contribute to deck plate logistics support problems. <a title=\"MSAT\" href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/products/msat-explained/\">Learn more about MSAT</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The sole function of an integrated logistics support solution is to facilitate efficient and effective execution of system maintenance functions. The only way to truly measure the effectiveness of these products (and the processes behind them) is to analyze actual system failures to see how well the logistics support system supported the maintenance action. To do this, logistics support analysts need to take a close look at all maintenance actions to determine exactly what failed, what logistics support was required to restore the system, and whether or not that support was readily identifiable and available to the system technician. Finding and fixing the root cause of these problems is what ATS does best.</p>\r\n<p>ATS can help you outline a sustainment strategy/plan to deliver increased readiness and availability.<strong> <a href=\"http://atsid.com/contact-us?interest=msat-demo\">Contact ATS</a> </strong>today to learn more about our in-depth Maintenance and Readiness Support Services.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3> </h3>','Maintenance and Supportability Analysis','','publish','open','open','','maintenance-and-supportability-analysis','','','2014-09-16 22:04:02','2014-09-16 22:04:02','',120,'http://dev.atsid.com/?page_id=260',0,'page','',0),(261,3,'2014-07-18 19:27:04','2014-07-18 19:27:04','<h3>Third data patent for relational graphing analysis engine</h3>\r\n<strong>Silverdale, Wash. - Jan. 5, 2012</strong> - Applied Technical Systems (ATS) has announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued a patent for an innovative cellular-like data model to describe and relate complex data structures, perform distributed data analytics and find similar data based on like connections and attributes.

The program was formally commissioned as a Navy-wide maintenance improvement effort. Leenstra decided to settle down in Washington with his family upon retirement after 23 years of enlisted and commissioned service. Leenstra was asked by a senior NAVSEA official coordinating the ILO efforts to continue implementing the ILO effort as a contractor. Leensstra agreed and formed ATS as a means to work with the Navy to fully implement the ILO program.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_280\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/ADMJackWilliams_1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-280 size-thumbnail\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/ADMJackWilliams_1-150x142.jpg\" alt=\"ADMJackWilliams_1\" width=\"150\" height=\"142\" /></a> ADM Jack Williams, then Chief of Naval Material teaching COSAL[/caption]\r\n<h3>ATS legacy with Admiral J. G. Jack Williams, USN</h3>\r\n<div>Admiral Jack Williams graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946 and reported to a destroyer as Gun Boss. After completing submarine training he served on USS Pompodon (SS-486) and USS Stickelback (SS-415). He later commanded USS Sterlet (SS-392) and after nuclear power training commanded USS Haddo (SSN-604) and USS Daniel Webster (SSBN-626). After a tour as Director of Training for Naval Reactors, he assumed duties as Force Material Officer (N4) for Commander Submarine Forces, Atlantic. He then took command of Submarine Squadron 16 in Rota, Spain. Upon completion of that tour he was selected for Rear Admiral and subsequently served as Naval Attaché to the Turkish Navy. Later he commanded Submarine Group Five in San Diego. Upon promotion to Vice Admiral he served as Deputy Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet and then as Vice Chief of Naval Operations for Submarine Warfare. In 1981 he was promoted to Admiral and assigned duties as Chief of Naval Material. Admiral Williams retired from the Navy in 1983 and returned to his boyhood home in Illwaco, Washington.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nIn 1984 he joined ATS as a director and eventually assumed the position of Chairman of the Board, which he held until his unexpected death in 1991. During this period Admiral Williams was instrumental in creating the Naval Undersea Museum in Keyport, served as President of the Northwest Chapter of the Naval Submarine League, and was a key player in helping ATS develop configuration-based lifecycle logistics support solutions for both submarines and surface ships.\r\n<h3>A heritage in solving complex data problems</h3>\r\n<div>Several years before XML became a de facto standard, ATS realized the need for a hierarchical, self-describing, data modeling and storage technology. ATS developed the Contiguous Connection Model (CCM) technology to facilitate rapid information retrieval, enhance data navigation and visualization, and promote knowledge discovery.  This patented technology (US Patent #s 5,303,367 and 5,555,409), which was revolutionary for its time, automatically correlates hierarchical data, models it, and stores it in expandable name/value pairs.  CCM goes much furtherit creates a complete new hierarchical structure for each and every data point, with the data point as the root.

ATS developed the Contiguous Connection Model (CCM) technology to facilitate rapid information retrieval, enhance data navigation and visualization, and promote knowledge discovery.  This patented technology (US Patent #s 5,303,367 and 5,555,409), which was revolutionary for its time, automatically correlates hierarchical data, models it, and stores it in expandable name/value pairs.  CCM goes much furtherit creates a complete new hierarchical structure for each and every data point, with the data point as the root. These \"inversions\" are permanently stored and can be intuitively browsed using our powerful visualization tools.\r\n\r\nThe third patent is for a Relational Generating Graph Analysis Engine (REGGAE). REGGAE has an innovative cellular-like data model used to describe and relate complex data structures, perform distributed data analytics and find similar data based on like connections and attributes. The patent was issued as US Patent No. 8,069,188.\r\n\r\nWhen asked to describe the value of the patent to ATS, co-author Bryan Tower stated, Since we applied for the patent in early 2008, ATS has implemented this engine in a variety of applications that need to analyze complex data relationships. In the intelligence community, we created an application called Hypergraph that uses the engine to perform distributed data analytics in a secure, private cloud computing environment. It enables analysts to quickly and easily perform multidimensional analysis on millions of text documents. The invention in this patent provides a means to discover behaviors and patterns among seemingly unrelated data. For example, a retail store can easily analyze its customer behaviors to determine which products are more suitable for different demographics. There are numerous applications in healthcare, evidence discovery, threat intelligence, and other areas.\r\n\r\nThe CCM technology is the pre-cursor to REGGAE, a core component of the <a href=\"http://atsid.com/solutions/it-solutions/data-analytics\">Arcus Cloud Analytical Platform</a>.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;','Patents','','inherit','open','open','','78-revision-v1','','','2014-07-18 20:28:58','2014-07-18 20:28:58','',78,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/18/78-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(285,3,'2014-07-18 21:03:12','2014-07-18 21:03:12','','msc1','Maintenance Support Center Data Analysis','inherit','open','open','','msc1','','','2014-07-18 21:03:12','2014-07-18 21:03:12','',260,'http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/msc1.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(287,3,'2014-07-18 21:08:49','2014-07-18 21:08:49','[caption id=\"attachment_288\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"213\"]<img class=\"wp-image-288 size-full\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/data-management.jpg\" alt=\"Defining, purifying and maintaining critical system data.\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /> Defining, purifying and maintaining critical system data.[/caption]\r\n<h3>Defining system configuration management to the maintenance level and maintaining it with progressive purification</h3>\r\n<div style=\"color: #000000;\">Configuration Data Management (CDM) is a discipline applied to a Configuration Item for its entire life cycle.

Our extensive practical experience working with all elements of logistics at all levels, coupled with our demonstrated ability to develop and deliver ILS training, is quite frankly unmatched anywhere in the industry.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">The Navys Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) system is a complex collection of organizations and activities that produce various pieces of the ILS puzzle. This shore-based system is not well defined or integrated, and is relatively fluid in both structure and processes. Most fleet personnel know very little about the ILS system or its products, largely because the system is not discussed or taught in any meaningful way in most training schools and there is little opportunity to learn system details when assigned to either ship or shore duty. This lack of education, understanding and experience in the details of the ILS system extends to engineering, operations, maintenance, and even supply personnelboth officer and enlisted. Some have some exposure to pieces of the system but few have any real in-depth experience with the full spectrum of ILS processes and products. This is unfortunate since the lack of onboard logistics support has repeatedly been identified by both the Chief of Naval Operations (as well as the GAO) as the single biggest contributing factor to poor system sustainability and operational readiness.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">ATS recognized this problem years ago when its founder started using shipboard technicians to develop and implement early Integrated Logistics Overhauls (ILO) processes in the Pacific Fleet. In order to teach sailors how to analyze and correct ILS deficiencies it was first necessary to define the processes through which each element of logistics support was produced. This then became the basis for training sailors how to troubleshoot and fix ILS problems for their systems during the ILO process.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">The ILS system training and outfitting processes developed during the 4-year Pacific Fleet ILO development process was the basis for the formation of ATS in 1980. The Navy wanted to expand the ILO effort Navy-wide and ATS was created and tasked to assist in that effort. This tasking included development of detailed procedures for conducting ILOs and providing both classroom and on-the-job training to start-up ILO sites in the Atlantic Fleet. ATS used this same ILS system theory and system supportability analysis processes to train its new employees, most of which were experienced maintenance technicians representing the full spectrum of ship systems. ATS has maintained its in-house training program to reflect the many changes in ILS products and processes that have occurred over the past 30 years. This training program continues to be the primary means of converting newly hired shipboard maintenance (and supply) technicians into qualified maintenance/logistics support analysts. It is also the basis for development of various training programs we have developed for our customers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">After training start-up sites in basic ILO procedures, ATS was tasked to design and develop a comprehensive training course for ship maintenance and supply personnel in the use and maintenance of all ILS products during the ships operating cycle. ATS developed a two-week course called the Integrated Shipboard Maintenance Support (ISMS) course which was designed for senior ship maintenance and supply personnel. The course included one week of system theory and another week of practical ILS troubleshooting and repair procedures using real problems in real products on real ships. Using four 2-man travelling instructor teams, the highly successful ISMS courses were taught to thousands of sailors and officers on all types of ships in all major home ports for a period of about 5 years.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">As an outgrowth of the ISMS training program, ATS conceived, designed and developed the shipboard Maintenance Support Center (MSC) concept for aircraft carriers. The MSC concept focused ISMS training on 12-16 maintenance and supply technicians assigned full-time to the newly created MSC, rather than trying to train literally hundreds of work center personnel on CV/CVNs. The MSC concept was implemented on the first carriers in the mid-80s and ATS continues to provide on-site and at-sea training and technical assistance to MSCs on all matters related to ILS problems on all aircraft carriers, in both the Pacific and Atlantic fleet. This training includes specialized training in computer-based shipboard maintenance and supply systems, including OMMS-NG, MODES and R-Supply as well as off-ships systems such as CDMD-OA, COSAL, WSF, CSMP and many others.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">ATS has also developed and delivered ISMS-like training for shipyard material management personnel called Shipyard Material Identification Course (SMIC). SMIC designed to teach shipyard civil service personnel how to use various ILS products to better identify and order material requirements for complex overhauls. SMIC training was provided to hundreds of shipyard personnel in all naval shipyards for a period of several years.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><a title=\"Contact Us\" href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/meet-ats/contact-us/\">Contact ATS today</a> to learn more.</p>','ILS Training Services','','publish','open','open','','ils-training-services','','','2014-07-18 21:38:11','2014-07-18 21:38:11','',293,'http://dev.atsid.com/?page_id=300',0,'page','',0),(301,3,'2014-07-18 21:37:11','2014-07-18 21:37:11','','classroom_training','Delivering comprehensive ILS Training to ship maintenance personnel','inherit','open','open','','classroom_training','','','2014-07-18 21:37:11','2014-07-18 21:37:11','',300,'http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/classroom_training.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(302,3,'2014-07-18 21:38:11','2014-07-18 21:38:11','[caption id=\"attachment_301\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"213\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-301\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/classroom_training.jpg\" alt=\"Delivering comprehensive ILS Training to ship maintenance personnel\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /> Delivering comprehensive ILS Training to ship maintenance personnel[/caption]\r\n<h3>Preparing the support community to maintain the finest fleet in the world</h3>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">ATS is well positioned to design, develop and implement any type of ILS training program our customers may require -- and we dont have to start from scratch.

At ATS we offer employees the chance to work with great people, on exciting projects, with a ton of opportunity for growth.<br /> But we also recognize that ATSers have a life outside of work and need a break every once in a while. That\'s why we provide a full range of benefits for you and your eligible family members. While the benefits may vary slightly from location to location, these are the basics for full-time, U.S. employees:</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://www.premera.com/stellent/groups/public/documents/xcpproject/img_logo.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h3>Medical, Dental and Vision</h3>\r\n<p>Our employees are our top priority. Thats why ATS pays 100% of each employees healthcare premium. Have a family? No problem, we pay the majority of their premium, too! And with small co-pays and low deductibles, its easy to make sure you and your family are in tip-top shape.</p>\r\n<h3>401K Matching</h3>\r\n<p>We believe we should take care of our employeesnow AND in the future. We offer 100% matching on all 401K contributions up to 3% of an employees compensation and an additional 50% matching up to 5%. The maximum we will match is 4%. Its a great investment in your future and who doesnt love free money?<br /> <img class=\"media-image\" src=\"http://www.atsid.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/prudential_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"60\" /></p>\r\n<h3>Profit Sharing</h3>\r\n<p>ATS may make a profit sharing contribution at the end of the fiscal year, which will be divided between employee-elected accounts based on your compensation for the year. The employee must be employed on the last day of the fiscal year (9/30) to be eligible. Vesting starts after two years and an employee is 100% vested after five years.</p>\r\n<h3>Flexible Schedule</h3>\r\n<p>We realize not all our employees enjoy getting up before the birds and that not everyone prefers to work into the evening hours. As long as your preferred schedule meets your supervisors approval and your projects needs you can choose your own schedule.</p>\r\n<h2>Leave/Holidays</h2>\r\n<h3>Paid Time Off (PTO)</h3>\r\n<p>Most new permanent, full-time employees earn 96 hours (12 days) of Paid Time Off throughout the year, which will accrue during each pay period. If you stay with the company long enough (we think youll like us), you could earn up to 296 hours (37 days) of PTO a year!</p>\r\n<h3>Holidays</h3>\r\n<p>Our employees enjoy the flexibility of 10 floating holidays (80 hours), which can be used at any time during the year. New employees will receive prorated holiday pay based on when in the fiscal year they join us.</p>\r\n<h3>Bereavement</h3>\r\n<p>In the event of the loss of an immediate family member, we will grant permanent employees up to five working days of bereavement leave without the loss of pay.</p>\r\n<h3>Disability</h3>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;\">Permanent employees normally scheduled to work at least 20 hours per week are eligible for disability leave accrual (paid for by ATS). Disability leave is accrued at the rate of one day per month (1/2 day for part-time employees). Up to 6 weeks of disability leave may be granted as maternity leave. Up to 6 additional weeks of personal leave and/or leave without pay may be taken if desired.</span></h3>\r\n<h2><img src=\"http://www.guardianlife.com/glifepp/fragments/glic_assets_frag/images/guardian-logo.gif\" alt=\"\" /></h2>\r\n<h2>Life Insurance</h2>\r\n<p>ATS offers company-paid term life insurance for each employee at no cost to the employee in the amount of three times the basic annual salary to a maximum of $500,000. In the case of accidental death, the amount is six times the basic annual salary to a maximum of $1,000,000.<br /> We also have additional supplemental life insurance available for employees, their spouses and their children at the employees expense.<br /> In addition, we also offer group plans (premiums paid through payroll deduction) for the following supplemental insurance packages:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Personal Accident Expense</li>\r\n<li>Personal Cancer Protector</li>\r\n<li>Hospital Intensive Care Plan</li>\r\n<li>Personal Recovery Plus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Tuition Assistance?</h3>\r\n<p>We love to expand our knowledge, and we want our employees to as well. We offer tuition assistance to our employees when they are furthering their education in a field directly related to their work here at ATS. Employees must complete the course with a 3.0 or better. In return, the employee will be required to work one full year beyond the completion date of the last class taken.</p>\r\n<h3>Personal Computer Loan Program</h3>\r\n<p>ATS will fund the purchase of PCs for employee home use through an interest-free loan up to $3,000. The employee will repay the loan within 12 months through a payroll deduction.</p>\r\n<h3>Friendly, Fun Atmosphere</h3>\r\n<p>While the size of offices vary from location to location, we all have one thing in common: we enjoy working together. Youll often see employees ordering takeout and spending their lunchtime together. People will bring in plants and goodies from their garden and baked goods from home to share with everyone. During December, some employees may put together a meal rotation so breakfast, lunch and a later meal are always available to enjoy. We even have a company soccer team and an \"Adopt-a-Road\" volunteer team. Thats how much we like each other we are willing to spend time away from work with each other!</p>\r\n<h3>Relocation Assistance:</h3>\r\n<p>ATS may provide relocation assistance for certain positions. (Ask your interviewer whether the position is eligible for relocation assistance.) Note: relocation benefits are not available for hourly positions.</p>','Benefits','','publish','open','open','','benefits','','','2014-08-27 17:17:06','2014-08-27 17:17:06','',29,'http://dev.atsid.com/?page_id=328',5,'page','',0),(329,3,'2014-07-18 22:04:59','2014-07-18 22:04:59','<p style=\"color: #000000;\">There are many things to consider when deciding on your next employer.

Its a great investment in your future and who doesnt love free money?\r\n<img class=\"media-image\" src=\"http://www.atsid.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/prudential_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"60\" />\r\n<h3>Profit Sharing</h3>\r\nATS may make a profit sharing contribution at the end of the fiscal year, which will be divided between employee-elected accounts based on your compensation for the year. The employee must be employed on the last day of the fiscal year (9/30) to be eligible. Vesting starts after two years and an employee is 100% vested after five years.\r\n<h3>Flexible Schedule</h3>\r\nWe realize not all our employees enjoy getting up before the birds and that not everyone prefers to work into the evening hours. As long as your preferred schedule meets your supervisors approval and your projects needs you can choose your own schedule.\r\n<h2>Leave/Holidays</h2>\r\n?<h3>Paid Time Off (PTO)</h3>\r\n\r\nMost new permanent, full-time employees earn 96 hours (12 days) of Paid Time Off throughout the year, which will accrue during each pay period. If you stay with the company long enough (we think youll like us), you could earn up to 296 hours (37 days) of PTO a year!\r\n?<h3>Holidays</h3>?\r\nOur employees enjoy the flexibility of 10 floating holidays (80 hours), which can be used at any time during the year. New employees will receive prorated holiday pay based on when in the fiscal year they join us.\r\n?<h3>Bereavement</h3>?\r\nIn the event of the loss of an immediate family member, we will grant permanent employees up to five working days of bereavement leave without the loss of pay.\r\n?<h3>Disability</h3>?\r\nPermanent employees normally scheduled to work at least 20 hours per week are eligible for disability leave accrual (paid for by ATS). Disability leave is accrued at the rate of one day per month (1/2 day for part-time employees). Up to 6 weeks of disability leave may be granted as maternity leave. Up to 6 additional weeks of personal leave and/or leave without pay may be taken if desired.\r\n<h2><img src=\"http://www.guardianlife.com/glifepp/fragments/glic_assets_frag/images/guardian-logo.gif\" alt=\"\" /></h2>\r\n<h2>Life Insurance</h2>\r\nATS offers company-paid term life insurance for each employee at no cost to the employee in the amount of three times the basic annual salary to a maximum of $500,000. In the case of accidental death, the amount is six times the basic annual salary to a maximum of $1,000,000.\r\nWe also have additional supplemental life insurance available for employees, their spouses and their children at the employees expense.\r\nIn addition, we also offer group plans (premiums paid through payroll deduction) for the following supplemental insurance packages:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Personal Accident Expense</li>\r\n	<li>Personal Cancer Protector</li>\r\n	<li>Hospital Intensive Care Plan</li>\r\n	<li>Personal Recovery Plus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n?<h3>Tuition Assistance</h3>?\r\nWe love to expand our knowledge, and we want our employees to as well. We offer tuition assistance to our employees when they are furthering their education in a field directly related to their work here at ATS. Employees must complete the course with a 3.0 or better. In return, the employee will be required to work one full year beyond the completion date of the last class taken.\r\n?<h3>Personal Computer Loan Program</h3>\r\n\r\nATS will fund the purchase of PCs for employee home use through an interest-free loan up to $3,000. The employee will repay the loan within 12 months through a payroll deduction.\r\n?<h3>Friendly, Fun Atmosphere</h3>\r\n\r\nWhile the size of offices vary from location to location, we all have one thing in common: we enjoy working together. Youll often see employees ordering takeout and spending their lunchtime together. People will bring in plants and goodies from their garden and baked goods from home to share with everyone. During December, some employees may put together a meal rotation so breakfast, lunch and a later meal are always available to enjoy. We even have a company soccer team and an \"Adopt-a-Road\" volunteer team. Thats how much we like each other we are willing to spend time away from work with each other!\r\n?<h3>Relocation Assistance:</h3>\r\n\r\nATS may provide relocation assistance for certain positions. (Ask your interviewer whether the position is eligible for relocation assistance.) Note: relocation benefits are not available for hourly positions.','Benefits','','inherit','open','open','','328-revision-v1','','','2014-07-18 22:17:08','2014-07-18 22:17:08','',328,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/18/328-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(337,3,'2014-07-18 22:29:29','2014-07-18 22:29:29','<aside class=\"alignright\">\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_338\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"213\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-338\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/2.jpg\" alt=\"College Interns Mackenzie, Jamison and Mitchell\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /> College Interns Mackenzie, Jamison and Mitchell[/caption]</p>\r\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_339\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"213\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-339\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/3.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Wilson and Chris Prince (R&amp;D Lead)\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /> Kate Wilson and Chris Prince (R&amp;D Lead)[/caption]<br />\r\n</aside>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">Applied Technical Systems is looking for talented individuals in high school or college, interested in software development.

If you are a possible match for the position, a recruiter will contact you to learn more about your background and answer questions about our hiring process and what it\'s like to work at ATS.\r\n<h3>Phone interview</h3>\r\nYouve applied for the position and your skills fit the job. The phone interview assesses your technical skills and proficiency, to the level of determining whether you should be brought in for in-person interviews. Typically phone interviews are conducted by someone in a similar role and last about 30-40 minutes.\r\n<h3>Onsite interview</h3>\r\nOur interview process for technical positions evaluates your core software engineering skills including: coding, algorithm development, data structures, design patterns, analytical thinking skills. During your interview, youll meet with several engineers across different teams who will give a cross-section view of ATS Software Engineering. Interviewers will ask you questions related to your area of interest and ask you to solve them in real time. Our interview process for business and general positions evaluate your problem solving and behavioral abilities. Remember, it\'s not a question of getting the answer right or wrong, but the process in which you use to solve it. Creativity is important.\r\n<h3>Hire by committee</h3>\r\nVirtually every person who interviews at ATS talks to at least four interviewers, drawn from both management and potential colleagues. Everyone\'s opinion counts, ensuring our hiring process is fair while maintaining high standards as we grow. Yes, it takes longer, but we believe it\'s worth it. If you hire great people and involve them intensively in the hiring process, youll get more great people. We started building this positive feedback loop when the company was founded, and it has had a huge payoff.\r\n<h3>What happens next</h3>\r\nFollowing your interviews, we will decide if you are suitable for the job opening. We take hiring very seriously and like to make consensus-based decisions. To that end, it can take up to two weeks for us to make a definitive decision as to whether we\'d like to have you join the team. Please be patient with us  your recruiter will keep in touch with you when feedback has been received and decisions made. Also feel free to get in touch with your recruiter at any time.','Applying at ATS','','publish','open','open','','applying-at-ats','','','2014-07-18 22:46:35','2014-07-18 22:46:35','',350,'http://dev.atsid.com/?page_id=353',0,'page','',0),(354,3,'2014-07-18 22:46:35','2014-07-18 22:46:35','Once you apply for a job, your qualifications and experience will be reviewed by one of our recruiters to determine if you are a fit.

The program was formally commissioned as a Navy-wide maintenance improvement effort. Leenstra decided to settle down in Washington with his family upon retirement after 23 years of enlisted and commissioned service. Leenstra was asked by a senior NAVSEA official coordinating the ILO efforts to continue implementing the ILO effort as a contractor. Leensstra agreed and formed ATS as a means to work with the Navy to fully implement the ILO program.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_280\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/ADMJackWilliams_1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-280 size-thumbnail\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/ADMJackWilliams_1-150x142.jpg\" alt=\"ADMJackWilliams_1\" width=\"150\" height=\"142\" /></a> ADM Jack Williams, then Chief of Naval Material teaching COSAL[/caption]\r\n<h3>ATS legacy with Admiral J. G. Jack Williams, USN</h3>\r\n<div>Admiral Jack Williams graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946 and reported to a destroyer as Gun Boss. After completing submarine training he served on USS Pompodon (SS-486) and USS Stickelback (SS-415). He later commanded USS Sterlet (SS-392) and after nuclear power training commanded USS Haddo (SSN-604) and USS Daniel Webster (SSBN-626). After a tour as Director of Training for Naval Reactors, he assumed duties as Force Material Officer (N4) for Commander Submarine Forces, Atlantic. He then took command of Submarine Squadron 16 in Rota, Spain. Upon completion of that tour he was selected for Rear Admiral and subsequently served as Naval Attaché to the Turkish Navy. Later he commanded Submarine Group Five in San Diego. Upon promotion to Vice Admiral he served as Deputy Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet and then as Vice Chief of Naval Operations for Submarine Warfare. In 1981 he was promoted to Admiral and assigned duties as Chief of Naval Material. Admiral Williams retired from the Navy in 1983 and returned to his boyhood home in Illwaco, Washington.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nIn 1984 he joined ATS as a director and eventually assumed the position of Chairman of the Board, which he held until his unexpected death in 1991. During this period Admiral Williams was instrumental in creating the Naval Undersea Museum in Keyport, served as President of the Northwest Chapter of the Naval Submarine League, and was a key player in helping ATS develop configuration-based lifecycle logistics support solutions for both submarines and surface ships.\r\n<h3>A heritage in solving complex data problems</h3>\r\n<div>Several years before XML became a de facto standard, ATS realized the need for a hierarchical, self-describing, data modeling and storage technology. ATS developed the Contiguous Connection Model (CCM) technology to facilitate rapid information retrieval, enhance data navigation and visualization, and promote knowledge discovery.  This patented technology (US Patent #s 5,303,367 and 5,555,409), which was revolutionary for its time, automatically correlates hierarchical data, models it, and stores it in expandable name/value pairs.  CCM goes much furtherit creates a complete new hierarchical structure for each and every data point, with the data point as the root. These \"inversions\" are permanently stored and can be intuitively browsed using our powerful visualization tools.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nCCM was the pre-cursor to REGGAE, patented under  8,069,188 which is a core component of the ATS Cloud Analytical Platform.  REGGAE is an innovative cellular-like data model to describe and relate complex data structures, perform distributed data analytics and find similar data based on like connections and attributes. The invention in this latest patent provides a means to easily discover behaviors and patterns among seemingly unrelated data. For example, a retail store can easily analyze its customer behaviors to determine which products are more suitable for different demographics.  There are numerous applications in healthcare, evidence discovery, threat intelligence, etc.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','History','','inherit','open','open','','72-revision-v1','','','2014-07-18 23:53:17','2014-07-18

Analysis of ship-generated 3M maintenance actions consistently shows that on average 2/3 of all maintenance actions involve replacement of failed parts. If the required parts are available from shipboard stocks, the system is usually quickly restored. If the parts are not available, the equipment/system will be down or degraded until the parts are received from off-ship sources.\n\nThe ready availability of onboard repair parts (OBRP) is clearly one of the most critical factors in operational readiness. But, despite its importance, serious OBRP availability problems continue to plague the fleet. For over 40 years the Navy has been tracking OBRP effectiveness data through the 3M system. The data shows that, on average, 50% of the time that a technician needs a replacement part, it will not be available from shipboard supply. The numbers are a little better for submarines and a little worse for aircraft carriers, but the 50% number has held steady for years, and in fact is getting worse. What this means is that 50% of the time a technician needs a part, it has to be ordered from off-ship sourceswhich GAO and other studies show takes an average of 18 days. Again, this means the system will stay down or degraded until the part comes in, and that kind of logistics delay time has a dramatic affect on operational readiness. It is also the source of much frustration for shipboard sailors since there is little they can do about the problem. Poor parts support is a major contributor to the loss of organic maintenance capabilityas highlighted in the Balisle report of Surface Force Readiness.\n\nAlthough the lack of OBRP support is typically viewed as a supply problem, the underlying cause of these problems is often rooted in an engineering or maintenance data problem which manifests itself as a supply problem. OBRP requirements are defined and driven by the Coordinated Shipboard Allowance List (COSAL) process. In short, the COSAL is the machine that puts parts onboard for all other machinesand like any other machine if it fails to function it needs to be trouble shot and fixed. The COSAL is driven by system configuration data maintained by the In-service Engineering Agents (ISEA) in the Configuration Data Manager Database. Repair part maintenance requirements and repair philosophy are developed during the equipment acquisition and provisioning process and encoded into the constituent Allowance Parts Lists (APLs), also by the ISEAs. This data in turn plays a big part in the allowance calculation process, which defines which parts will be carried in ship supplyand any errors in this engineering/maintenance data will typically translate into OBRP support problems.\n\nThe CNO minimum requirement for COSAL OBRP effectiveness is 65%. But even that relatively low expectation has never been achieved, except for special interest systems that have their own support system. There have been a number of studies and analyses conducted by the GAO and others over the years that address this problem. These studies show that there are serious systemic problems that in combination contribute to the poor parts availability situation in the fleet. Salient systemic problems include:\n<ol>\n	<li>Incomplete and inaccurate system configuration data for shipboard systems.</li>\n	<li>Incomplete and inaccurate maintenance and supply support data on equipment Allowance Parts Lists (APLs)</li>\n	<li>Problems with repair part sparing models (Policy)</li>\n</ol>\nFor over 30 years, ATS has been working to isolate and solve (or at least alleviate) OBRP support problems for the Navy. These efforts include development and implementation of several major ILS/OBRP improvement efforts. These include the Integrated Logistics Overhaul (ILO) program; the Integrated Shipboard Maintenance Support (ISMS) training program; the aircraft carrier Maintenance Support Center (MSC) program, and the submarine Enhanced Integrated Logistics Overhaul (E-ILO) program. These and other efforts were aimed at finding ways to better integrate engineering, maintenance, and logistics support data and products through a common configuration connection. It is no secret that the Navys integrated logistics support processes and products are anything but integrated. The shore-based system is a convoluted collection of organizations and activities, each focused on its particular piece of the logistics puzzle with little integration of data or effort. Engineering data is maintained in one database, maintenance data in another, and supply data in yet anotherand the list goes on. All of these lifecycle support functions are configuration-dependent, yet none operate from a common definition of the configuration items (CI) that collectively constitute ship systems. Consequently, all are generally out of sync with actual system configuration, and with each other. The end result is poor onboard logistics support, particularly parts.\n\nOur experience has shown that it is difficult to identify problems with any particular element of logistics in isolation of all other elements, and of course system configuration data. For example, one cant look at an APL and determine that the maintenance coding for a particular part is wrong just by looking at it. However, when the APL data is married to IETM data that tells a sailor how to replace the part but the APL maintenance coding (SM&amp;R) says its a depot remove and replace part only, this inconsistency becomes immediately apparent. When this same data is further connected to actual maintenance failures for a particular system, one begins to see inconsistencies between what the sailor is actually doing, what the TM says to do, and what the maintenance philosophy encoded in the APL says to do. These are not isolated problems; they are common and completely predictable given the nature of the independent nature of the shore-based systems that produce them.\n\nIn order to deal with the underlying data integration problem, ATS has developed a unique data connection and correlation system that allows us to download system engineering, maintenance and logistics support data which is linked to a common configuration item (CI). Called the Maintenance &amp; Supportability Analysis Tool (MSAT), this tool supports data ingestion and integration from any source database and connects it all in such a way that discrepancies become immediately visible. The system was recently tested on a radar system, with alarming results. The system showed major discrepancies between engineering drawing BOM data and the IETM. For example, there were hundreds of parts listed in the IETM that do not connect to either the BOM or the APL. Moreover, there were hundreds of parts listed on the APL that did not connect back to the IETM or the BOM. Several hundred fleet maintenance items were analyzed and linked to the CI. Most of these involved replacement of repair parts, and only 4% were satisfied from onboard stock. Further analysis showed that the majority of these would never be allowed because the APL had them coded for intermediate or depot level maintenance only, which although clearly incorrect automatically prevented these items from even being considered for OBRP allowance. This was true even for Preventive Maintenance (PM) items identified on the Maintenance Requirement Cards (MRC).\n\nThese are just a few examples of the types of engineering, maintenance, and logistics support data disconnects that MSAT reveals.

Analysis of ship-generated 3M maintenance actions consistently shows that on average 2/3 of all maintenance actions involve replacement of failed parts. If the required parts are available from shipboard stocks, the system is usually quickly restored. If the parts are not available, the equipment/system will be down or degraded until the parts are received from off-ship sources.\r\n\r\nThe ready availability of onboard repair parts (OBRP) is clearly one of the most critical factors in operational readiness. But, despite its importance, serious OBRP availability problems continue to plague the fleet. For over 40 years the Navy has been tracking OBRP effectiveness data through the 3M system. The data shows that, on average, 50% of the time that a technician needs a replacement part, it will not be available from shipboard supply. The numbers are a little better for submarines and a little worse for aircraft carriers, but the 50% number has held steady for years, and in fact is getting worse. What this means is that 50% of the time a technician needs a part, it has to be ordered from off-ship sourceswhich GAO and other studies show takes an average of 18 days. Again, this means the system will stay down or degraded until the part comes in, and that kind of logistics delay time has a dramatic affect on operational readiness. It is also the source of much frustration for shipboard sailors since there is little they can do about the problem. Poor parts support is a major contributor to the loss of organic maintenance capabilityas highlighted in the Balisle report of Surface Force Readiness.\r\n\r\nAlthough the lack of OBRP support is typically viewed as a supply problem, the underlying cause of these problems is often rooted in an engineering or maintenance data problem which manifests itself as a supply problem. OBRP requirements are defined and driven by the Coordinated Shipboard Allowance List (COSAL) process. In short, the COSAL is the machine that puts parts onboard for all other machinesand like any other machine if it fails to function it needs to be trouble shot and fixed. The COSAL is driven by system configuration data maintained by the In-service Engineering Agents (ISEA) in the Configuration Data Manager Database. Repair part maintenance requirements and repair philosophy are developed during the equipment acquisition and provisioning process and encoded into the constituent Allowance Parts Lists (APLs), also by the ISEAs. This data in turn plays a big part in the allowance calculation process, which defines which parts will be carried in ship supplyand any errors in this engineering/maintenance data will typically translate into OBRP support problems.\r\n\r\nThe CNO minimum requirement for COSAL OBRP effectiveness is 65%. But even that relatively low expectation has never been achieved, except for special interest systems that have their own support system. There have been a number of studies and analyses conducted by the GAO and others over the years that address this problem. These studies show that there are serious systemic problems that in combination contribute to the poor parts availability situation in the fleet. Salient systemic problems include:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Incomplete and inaccurate system configuration data for shipboard systems.</li>\r\n	<li>Incomplete and inaccurate maintenance and supply support data on equipment Allowance Parts Lists (APLs)</li>\r\n	<li>Problems with repair part sparing models (Policy)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nFor over 30 years, ATS has been working to isolate and solve (or at least alleviate) OBRP support problems for the Navy. These efforts include development and implementation of several major ILS/OBRP improvement efforts. These include the Integrated Logistics Overhaul (ILO) program; the Integrated Shipboard Maintenance Support (ISMS) training program; the aircraft carrier Maintenance Support Center (MSC) program, and the submarine Enhanced Integrated Logistics Overhaul (E-ILO) program. These and other efforts were aimed at finding ways to better integrate engineering, maintenance, and logistics support data and products through a common configuration connection. It is no secret that the Navys integrated logistics support processes and products are anything but integrated. The shore-based system is a convoluted collection of organizations and activities, each focused on its particular piece of the logistics puzzle with little integration of data or effort. Engineering data is maintained in one database, maintenance data in another, and supply data in yet anotherand the list goes on. All of these lifecycle support functions are configuration-dependent, yet none operate from a common definition of the configuration items (CI) that collectively constitute ship systems. Consequently, all are generally out of sync with actual system configuration, and with each other. The end result is poor onboard logistics support, particularly parts.\r\n\r\nOur experience has shown that it is difficult to identify problems with any particular element of logistics in isolation of all other elements, and of course system configuration data. For example, one cant look at an APL and determine that the maintenance coding for a particular part is wrong just by looking at it. However, when the APL data is married to IETM data that tells a sailor how to replace the part but the APL maintenance coding (SM&amp;R) says its a depot remove and replace part only, this inconsistency becomes immediately apparent. When this same data is further connected to actual maintenance failures for a particular system, one begins to see inconsistencies between what the sailor is actually doing, what the TM says to do, and what the maintenance philosophy encoded in the APL says to do. These are not isolated problems; they are common and completely predictable given the nature of the independent nature of the shore-based systems that produce them.\r\n\r\nIn order to deal with the underlying data integration problem, ATS has developed a unique data connection and correlation system that allows us to download system engineering, maintenance and logistics support data which is linked to a common configuration item (CI). Called the Maintenance &amp; Supportability Analysis Tool (MSAT), this tool supports data ingestion and integration from any source database and connects it all in such a way that discrepancies become immediately visible. The system was recently tested on a radar system, with alarming results. The system showed major discrepancies between engineering drawing BOM data and the IETM. For example, there were hundreds of parts listed in the IETM that do not connect to either the BOM or the APL. Moreover, there were hundreds of parts listed on the APL that did not connect back to the IETM or the BOM. Several hundred fleet maintenance items were analyzed and linked to the CI. Most of these involved replacement of repair parts, and only 4% were satisfied from onboard stock. Further analysis showed that the majority of these would never be allowed because the APL had them coded for intermediate or depot level maintenance only, which although clearly incorrect automatically prevented these items from even being considered for OBRP allowance. This was true even for Preventive Maintenance (PM) items identified on the Maintenance Requirement Cards (MRC).\r\n\r\nThese are just a few examples of the types of engineering, maintenance, and logistics support data disconnects that MSAT reveals. It is interesting to note that for this one radar system, there were about 65,000 entities that collectively described the system, its engineering drawings, specifications, IETM parts list, maintenance actions, APLs, and so on. Using its unique data connection process, MSAT automatically created over 1.25 million connections among these data. These connections (or lack of connections) can then be used by SMEs to analyze all maintenance actions and to flush out and fix the root cause of OBRP and many other support problems.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-157\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/maint-support-img3_0-300x200.png\" alt=\"maint-support-img3_0\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />\r\n\r\nMSAT is currently being used to analyze and correct maintenance support and sustainability problems for other shipboard systems.\r\n\r\nFor more information about MSAT, or to schedule a demo, please contact our Maintenance Support Group.','Maintenance Support in the US Navy','','inherit','open','open','','148-revision-v1','','','2014-07-19 00:33:22','2014-07-19 00:33:22','',148,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/19/148-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(390,3,'2014-07-19 00:34:16','2014-07-19 00:34:16','','1.uspto_building','The USPTO Office','inherit','open','open','','1-uspto_building','','','2014-07-19 00:34:16','2014-07-19 00:34:16','',162,'http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/1.uspto_building.gif',0,'attachment','image/gif',0),(391,3,'2014-07-19 00:34:35','2014-07-19 00:34:35','','2.USPTO_','Patent End-to-End Overview','inherit','open','open','','2-uspto_','','','2014-07-19 00:34:35','2014-07-19 00:34:35','',162,'http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/2.USPTO_.gif',0,'attachment','image/gif',0),(392,3,'2014-07-21 18:55:31','2014-07-21 18:55:31','<aside class=\"alignright\">\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_390\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"213\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/1.uspto_building-1.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-390 size-full\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/1.uspto_building.gif\" alt=\"The USPTO Office\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /></a> The USPTO Office[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_391\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"213\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-391\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/2.USPTO_.gif\" alt=\"Patent End-to-End Overview\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /> Patent End-to-End Overview[/caption]\n\n</aside>\n<h3>The United States Patent and Trademark Office is faced with a growing patent backlog and antiquated tools for examination.</h3>\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">Patent examination is a complex process involving extensive searches for existing patented inventions and the authoring of legal documents asserting (or denying) an application\'s uniqueness as an invention.

Their primary mission is to collect and convey the essential information the President and members of the policymaking, law enforcement, and military communities require to execute their appointed duties.\r\n\r\nMembers of the IC collect and assess information regarding international terrorist and narcotic activities; other hostile activities by foreign powers, organizations, persons, and their agents; and foreign intelligence activities directed against the United States. As needed, the President may also direct the IC to carry out special activities in order to protect U.S. security interests against foreign threats.\r\n\r\nIn this case study, well focus on the tens of thousands of unstructured (plain text) messages the IC obtains every day. There is no way that an analyst can read all of these messages as they are received. The analysts need to find the most relevant messages and read those messages first. In addition, the IC needs the ability to understand and know what is in the data that they have already collected.\r\n\r\nThe ATS cloud-based conceptual search solution allows the IC to add large numbers of documents daily to existing data sets and helps analysts find the relevant documents more easily and faster. The conceptual search application provides a computer-assisted query interface that guides analysts to actual concepts that occur in the data set. This type of search is extremely helpful in the case where you dont know exactly what youre looking for.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the unstructured text, the IC also receives an enormous amount of structured data daily. ATS cloud-based graph analytics can rapidly identify similar entities embedded in this data. This allows an analyst to quickly find out what new entities are closely related to their current entities of interest. The ATS graph analytics run on billions of entities with sub-second response times as users manipulate the data. The ability to ask many questions and get rapid answers helps analysts discover interesting trends and weed out unnecessary information quickly. This permits an analyst to focus in on actionable intelligence faster than ever before.','Data Analytics in Intelligence Community','','inherit','open','open','','141-revision-v1','','','2014-07-21 18:24:55','2014-07-21 18:24:55','',141,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/21/141-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(433,3,'2014-07-21 18:25:17','2014-07-21 18:25:17','<aside class=\"alignright\">\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_429\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/2-2.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-429 size-medium\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/2-2-300x210.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" /></a> Potential anomalies discovered[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_430\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/1-1.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-430 size-medium\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/1-1-300x210.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" /></a> Bi-partite graph with REGGAE[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_431\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/3-1.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-431 size-medium\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/3-1-300x210.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" /></a> Analyst Tool Kit[/caption]\r\n\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) is a coalition of 17 agencies and organizations within the executive branch that work both independently and collaboratively to gather the intelligence necessary to conduct foreign relations and national security activities.

Analysis of ship-generated 3M maintenance actions consistently shows that on average 2/3 of all maintenance actions involve replacement of failed parts. If the required parts are available from shipboard stocks, the system is usually quickly restored. If the parts are not available, the equipment/system will be down or degraded until the parts are received from off-ship sources.\r\n\r\nThe ready availability of onboard repair parts (OBRP) is clearly one of the most critical factors in operational readiness. But, despite its importance, serious OBRP availability problems continue to plague the fleet. For over 40 years the Navy has been tracking OBRP effectiveness data through the 3M system. The data shows that, on average, 50% of the time that a technician needs a replacement part, it will not be available from shipboard supply. The numbers are a little better for submarines and a little worse for aircraft carriers, but the 50% number has held steady for years, and in fact is getting worse. What this means is that 50% of the time a technician needs a part, it has to be ordered from off-ship sourceswhich GAO and other studies show takes an average of 18 days. Again, this means the system will stay down or degraded until the part comes in, and that kind of logistics delay time has a dramatic affect on operational readiness. It is also the source of much frustration for shipboard sailors since there is little they can do about the problem. Poor parts support is a major contributor to the loss of organic maintenance capabilityas highlighted in the Balisle report of Surface Force Readiness.\r\n\r\nAlthough the lack of OBRP support is typically viewed as a supply problem, the underlying cause of these problems is often rooted in an engineering or maintenance data problem which manifests itself as a supply problem. OBRP requirements are defined and driven by the Coordinated Shipboard Allowance List (COSAL) process. In short, the COSAL is the machine that puts parts onboard for all other machinesand like any other machine if it fails to function it needs to be trouble shot and fixed. The COSAL is driven by system configuration data maintained by the In-service Engineering Agents (ISEA) in the Configuration Data Manager Database. Repair part maintenance requirements and repair philosophy are developed during the equipment acquisition and provisioning process and encoded into the constituent Allowance Parts Lists (APLs), also by the ISEAs. This data in turn plays a big part in the allowance calculation process, which defines which parts will be carried in ship supplyand any errors in this engineering/maintenance data will typically translate into OBRP support problems.\r\n\r\nThe CNO minimum requirement for COSAL OBRP effectiveness is 65%. But even that relatively low expectation has never been achieved, except for special interest systems that have their own support system. There have been a number of studies and analyses conducted by the GAO and others over the years that address this problem. These studies show that there are serious systemic problems that in combination contribute to the poor parts availability situation in the fleet. Salient systemic problems include:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Incomplete and inaccurate system configuration data for shipboard systems.</li>\r\n	<li>Incomplete and inaccurate maintenance and supply support data on equipment Allowance Parts Lists (APLs)</li>\r\n	<li>Problems with repair part sparing models (Policy)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nFor over 30 years, ATS has been working to isolate and solve (or at least alleviate) OBRP support problems for the Navy. These efforts include development and implementation of several major ILS/OBRP improvement efforts. These include the Integrated Logistics Overhaul (ILO) program; the Integrated Shipboard Maintenance Support (ISMS) training program; the aircraft carrier Maintenance Support Center (MSC) program, and the submarine Enhanced Integrated Logistics Overhaul (E-ILO) program. These and other efforts were aimed at finding ways to better integrate engineering, maintenance, and logistics support data and products through a common configuration connection. It is no secret that the Navys integrated logistics support processes and products are anything but integrated. The shore-based system is a convoluted collection of organizations and activities, each focused on its particular piece of the logistics puzzle with little integration of data or effort. Engineering data is maintained in one database, maintenance data in another, and supply data in yet anotherand the list goes on. All of these lifecycle support functions are configuration-dependent, yet none operate from a common definition of the configuration items (CI) that collectively constitute ship systems. Consequently, all are generally out of sync with actual system configuration, and with each other. The end result is poor onboard logistics support, particularly parts.\r\n\r\nOur experience has shown that it is difficult to identify problems with any particular element of logistics in isolation of all other elements, and of course system configuration data. For example, one cant look at an APL and determine that the maintenance coding for a particular part is wrong just by looking at it. However, when the APL data is married to IETM data that tells a sailor how to replace the part but the APL maintenance coding (SM&amp;R) says its a depot remove and replace part only, this inconsistency becomes immediately apparent. When this same data is further connected to actual maintenance failures for a particular system, one begins to see inconsistencies between what the sailor is actually doing, what the TM says to do, and what the maintenance philosophy encoded in the APL says to do. These are not isolated problems; they are common and completely predictable given the nature of the independent nature of the shore-based systems that produce them.\r\n\r\nIn order to deal with the underlying data integration problem, ATS has developed a unique data connection and correlation system that allows us to download system engineering, maintenance and logistics support data which is linked to a common configuration item (CI). Called the Maintenance &amp; Supportability Analysis Tool (MSAT), this tool supports data ingestion and integration from any source database and connects it all in such a way that discrepancies become immediately visible. The system was recently tested on a radar system, with alarming results. The system showed major discrepancies between engineering drawing BOM data and the IETM. For example, there were hundreds of parts listed in the IETM that do not connect to either the BOM or the APL. Moreover, there were hundreds of parts listed on the APL that did not connect back to the IETM or the BOM. Several hundred fleet maintenance items were analyzed and linked to the CI. Most of these involved replacement of repair parts, and only 4% were satisfied from onboard stock. Further analysis showed that the majority of these would never be allowed because the APL had them coded for intermediate or depot level maintenance only, which although clearly incorrect automatically prevented these items from even being considered for OBRP allowance. This was true even for Preventive Maintenance (PM) items identified on the Maintenance Requirement Cards (MRC).\r\n\r\nThese are just a few examples of the types of engineering, maintenance, and logistics support data disconnects that MSAT reveals. It is interesting to note that for this one radar system, there were about 65,000 entities that collectively described the system, its engineering drawings, specifications, IETM parts list, maintenance actions, APLs, and so on. Using its unique data connection process, MSAT automatically created over 1.25 million connections among these data. These connections (or lack of connections) can then be used by SMEs to analyze all maintenance actions and to flush out and fix the root cause of OBRP and many other support problems.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-157\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/maint-support-img3_0-300x200.png\" alt=\"maint-support-img3_0\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />\r\n\r\nMSAT is currently being used to analyze and correct maintenance support and sustainability problems for other shipboard systems.\r\n\r\nFor more information about MSAT, or to schedule a demo, please contact our Maintenance Support Group.','Maintenance Support in the US Navy','','inherit','open','open','','148-revision-v1','','','2014-07-21 18:53:43','2014-07-21 18:53:43','',148,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/21/148-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(446,3,'2014-07-21 18:55:02','2014-07-21 18:55:02','','1.uspto_building-1','','inherit','open','open','','1-uspto_building-1','','','2014-07-21 18:55:02','2014-07-21 18:55:02','',0,'http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/1.uspto_building-1.gif',0,'attachment','image/gif',0),(447,3,'2014-07-21 18:55:40','2014-07-21 18:55:40','','2.USPTO_-1','','inherit','open','open','','2-uspto_-1','','','2014-07-21 18:55:40','2014-07-21 18:55:40','',0,'http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/2.USPTO_-1.gif',0,'attachment','image/gif',0),(448,3,'2014-07-21 18:56:06','2014-07-21 18:56:06','<aside class=\"alignright\">\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_390\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"213\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/1.uspto_building-1.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-390 size-full\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/1.uspto_building.gif\" alt=\"The USPTO Office\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /></a> The USPTO Office[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_391\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"213\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/2.USPTO_-1.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-391 size-full\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/2.USPTO_.gif\" alt=\"Patent End-to-End Overview\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /></a> Patent End-to-End Overview[/caption]\r\n\r\n</aside>\r\n<h3>The United States Patent and Trademark Office is faced with a growing patent backlog and antiquated tools for examination.</h3>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">Patent examination is a complex process involving extensive searches for existing patented inventions and the authoring of legal documents asserting (or denying) an application\'s uniqueness as an invention. Patent examiners are highly trained engineers with expertise in the subject area to which they are assigned. Unfortunately, the tools these examiners use for their investigations are an accumulation of disparate legacy software applications developed over the last 20 years. To make matters worse, these applications were not developed with any user interface consistency or thought toward maximizing efficiency. This results in a slow, error-prone process that diverts attention from the most important element of their job  making decisions on patentability. The process is so slow that the current patent backlog is nearing 700,000 applications, with only 6,800 examiners to evaluate them. Average time to grant a patent now sits at around 33 months from first submittal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The individuals evaluating patentability of the newest cutting edge technology are doing so with 20-year-old software applications and processes that can\'t keep up with the pace of innovation.</h3>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">Research has shown that information workers are most productive when the tools they use are so streamlined that they can get into a state of \"flow\"  a level of mental efficiency that allows full cognitive focus on the task, with minimal disruption from tools (such as error dialogs or hunting for obscure commands). Considering the number of patent applications submitted per week in the United States (approximately 5,000), patent examiners simply don\'t have the time to spend dealing with legacy systems. Their ability to enter a highly efficient work/thought mode for patent investigation is critical to manage such a high number of new applications.  In turn, more efficient patent processing will reduce the extreme costs (both financial and competitive) for entities seeking to protect intellectual property quickly and beat competitors to market.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">In order to help USPTO solve these problems, ATS is deploying a multi-faceted approach aimed at modernizing patent processing systems and keeping them compatible for future scalability.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>User-centered Design</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">Most importantly, ATS and partner Design for Context are building the new examination toolkit with user needs first. All interface designs are based on extensive examiner interviews and prototyping to evaluate the level of learnability, efficiency, and memorability. All application functionality, even the database modeling, is driven by front-end user needs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>Unified Toolkit</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">The tools examiners currently use consist of numerous standalone desktop applications. ATS is moving these tools into dynamic web applications with a unified interface. This will provide the ability to move data between tools seamlessly and take advantage of server-side processes to remember tasks, correlate data elements, and pre-fill data where needed   all of which were previously paper-based processes. A web-based environment also dramatically reduces deployment and maintenance costs for the Office of CIO.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>Service-oriented Architecture</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">A distributed, service-oriented architecture is utilized on the backend, in order to enable high scalability and interoperability of systems. This will allow new subsystems to be implemented as needed and connected to existing components using standards-based interfaces. The architecture also allows additional servers to be brought online easily, expanding the user and data load capacity seamlessly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>Agile Development</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">ATS engineers are experts at agile software development processes, and the USPTO has decided to use this approach for the development of the patent examiner toolkit. This leads to much lower cycle time, resulting in quicker feedback from users. The end result is a system that can be changed more readily to suit new information, such as additional data sources, without needing to re-architect the entire system using a months-long process. New directions and requirements from the client can be absorbed with minimal pain, and ATS can deliver the right development units at the right time.</p>\r\n&nbsp;','USPTO Patents End-to-End','','inherit','open','open','','162-revision-v1','','','2014-07-21 18:56:06','2014-07-21 18:56:06','',162,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/21/162-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(449,3,'2014-07-21 18:59:36','2014-07-21 18:59:36','<div class=\"field field-name-field-date field-type-datetime field-label-hidden clearfix\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\r\n<div class=\"field-items\">\r\n<div class=\"field-item even\"><span class=\"date-display-single\">Sunday, July 27, 2014</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-address field-type-addressfield field-label-hidden clearfix\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\r\n<div class=\"field-items\">\r\n<div class=\"field-item even\">\r\n<div class=\"addressfield-container-inline name-block\">\r\n<div class=\"name-block\">Silverdale Waterfront Park</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"addressfield-container-inline locality-block\"><span class=\"locality\">Silverdale</span>  <span class=\"state\">Washington</span>  <span class=\"postal-code\">98383</span></div>\r\n<span class=\"country\">United States</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','Whaling Days / Silverdale Rotary Duck Race','','publish','open','open','','whaling-days-silverdale-rotary-duck-race','','','2014-07-21 18:59:36','2014-07-21 18:59:36','',84,'http://dev.atsid.com/?page_id=449',0,'page','',0),(450,3,'2014-07-21 18:59:36','2014-07-21 18:59:36','<div class=\"field field-name-field-date field-type-datetime field-label-hidden clearfix\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\r\n<div class=\"field-items\">\r\n<div class=\"field-item even\"><span class=\"date-display-single\">Sunday, July 27, 2014</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-address field-type-addressfield field-label-hidden clearfix\" style=\"color: #000000;\">\r\n<div class=\"field-items\">\r\n<div class=\"field-item even\">\r\n<div class=\"addressfield-container-inline name-block\">\r\n<div class=\"name-block\">Silverdale Waterfront Park</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"addressfield-container-inline locality-block\"><span class=\"locality\">Silverdale</span>  <span class=\"state\">Washington</span>  <span class=\"postal-code\">98383</span></div>\r\n<span class=\"country\">United States</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','Whaling Days / Silverdale Rotary Duck Race','','inherit','open','open','','449-revision-v1','','','2014-07-21 18:59:36','2014-07-21 18:59:36','',449,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/21/449-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(451,3,'2014-07-21 18:59:55','2014-07-21 18:59:55','<div>\n\nLook for ATS at these upcoming Conferences &amp; Trade Shows.\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Event</th>\n<th>Location</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>July 27, 2014</td>\n<td><a title=\"Whaling Days / Silverdale Rotary Duck Race\" href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/meet-ats/meetings-events/whaling-days-silverdale-rotary-duck-race/\">Whaling Days / Silverdale Rotary Duck Race</a></td>\n<td>Silverdale Waterfront ParkSilverdale WA 98383</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>','Meetings & Events','','inherit','open','open','','84-autosave-v1','','','2014-07-21 18:59:55','2014-07-21 18:59:55','',84,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/21/84-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(452,3,'2014-07-21 18:59:57','2014-07-21 18:59:57','<div>\r\n\r\nLook for ATS at these upcoming Conferences &amp; Trade Shows.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Date</th>\r\n<th>Event</th>\r\n<th>Location</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>July 27, 2014</td>\r\n<td><a title=\"Whaling Days / Silverdale Rotary Duck Race\" href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/meet-ats/meetings-events/whaling-days-silverdale-rotary-duck-race/\">Whaling Days / Silverdale Rotary Duck Race</a></td>\r\n<td>Silverdale Waterfront ParkSilverdale WA 98383</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>','Meetings & Events','','inherit','open','open','','84-revision-v1','','','2014-07-21 18:59:57','2014-07-21 18:59:57','',84,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/21/84-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(453,3,'2014-07-21 19:06:11','2014-07-21 19:06:11','[caption id=\"attachment_249\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"213\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-249\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/lss_index.jpg\" alt=\"Keeping ships ready since 1980\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /> Keeping ships ready since 1980[/caption]\r\n<h2>ATS is focused on innovative and sustainable integrated logistic support and lifecycle support solutions.</h2>\r\nFor over 30 years, ATS has focused on the development of innovative and sustainable maintenance and lifecycle solutions to product lifecycle system support problems. From the outset, our emphasis has been on finding ways to make the products of the Navys logistics lifecycle support system work for, rather than against, the shipboard maintenance technician.\r\n\r\nMost Operational Availability (Ao) and system sustainability problems experienced by the fleet today can be traced to a failure somewhere in the shore-based lifecycle logistics support system. Lack of onboard repair parts (OBRP) supply support is a particularly acute system sustainability problem, but there are also systemic problems with technical manuals, drawings, configuration and other types of engineering technical data. In many cases these technical data problems are the root cause of OBRP support problems, but they are often perceived as a Supply support problem.\r\n\r\nATS uses our unique product lifecycle maintenance solutions to troubleshoot and correct lifecycle integrated logistics support and sustainability problems. Most of our Maintenance Support Group technicians are former Navy technicians who have extensive experience in the operation and maintenance of the full spectrum of shipboard systems. This maintenance-oriented perspective is fundamental to our view of the integrated logistics support world and our maintenance support analysis processes.\r\n\r\nWe train our maintenance support technicians using our own in-house lifecycle support management training program which we developed from years of hands on experience in all facets of the integrated logistics support system. The end result is an experienced shipboard maintenance technician who is also trained to troubleshoot and repair any element of the Navys integrated logistics support system to make sure the ILS system provides our sailors with the parts, data and tools they need to restore failed systems with minimal delay.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" align=\"left\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">\r\n<h2>Maintenance &amp; Supportability Analysis</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<h2>Configuration Data Management (CDM)</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>ATS has provided preventative and corrective maintenance support solutions to its customers for over 30 years.

The program was formally commissioned as a Navy-wide maintenance improvement effort. Leenstra decided to settle down in Washington with his family upon retirement after 23 years of enlisted and commissioned service. Leenstra was asked by a senior NAVSEA official coordinating the ILO efforts to continue implementing the ILO effort as a contractor. Leensstra agreed and formed ATS as a means to work with the Navy to fully implement the ILO program.</div>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_280\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/ADMJackWilliams_1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-280 size-thumbnail\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/ADMJackWilliams_1-150x142.jpg\" alt=\"ADMJackWilliams_1\" width=\"150\" height=\"142\" /></a> ADM Jack Williams, then Chief of Naval Material teaching COSAL[/caption]\r\n<h3>ATS legacy with Admiral J. G. Jack Williams, USN</h3>\r\n<div>Admiral Jack Williams graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946 and reported to a destroyer as Gun Boss. After completing submarine training he served on USS Pompodon (SS-486) and USS Stickelback (SS-415). He later commanded USS Sterlet (SS-392) and after nuclear power training commanded USS Haddo (SSN-604) and USS Daniel Webster (SSBN-626). After a tour as Director of Training for Naval Reactors, he assumed duties as Force Material Officer (N4) for Commander Submarine Forces, Atlantic. He then took command of Submarine Squadron 16 in Rota, Spain. Upon completion of that tour he was selected for Rear Admiral and subsequently served as Naval Attaché to the Turkish Navy. Later he commanded Submarine Group Five in San Diego. Upon promotion to Vice Admiral he served as Deputy Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet and then as Vice Chief of Naval Operations for Submarine Warfare. In 1981 he was promoted to Admiral and assigned duties as Chief of Naval Material. Admiral Williams retired from the Navy in 1983 and returned to his boyhood home in Illwaco, Washington.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>In 1984 he joined ATS as a director and eventually assumed the position of Chairman of the Board, which he held until his unexpected death in 1991. During this period Admiral Williams was instrumental in creating the Naval Undersea Museum in Keyport, served as President of the Northwest Chapter of the Naval Submarine League, and was a key player in helping ATS develop configuration-based lifecycle logistics support solutions for both submarines and surface ships.\r\n<h3>A heritage in solving complex data problems</h3>\r\n<div>Several years before XML became a de facto standard, ATS realized the need for a hierarchical, self-describing, data modeling and storage technology. ATS developed the Contiguous Connection Model (CCM) technology to facilitate rapid information retrieval, enhance data navigation and visualization, and promote knowledge discovery.  This patented technology (US Patent #s 5,303,367 and 5,555,409), which was revolutionary for its time, automatically correlates hierarchical data, models it, and stores it in expandable name/value pairs.  CCM goes much furtherit creates a complete new hierarchical structure for each and every data point, with the data point as the root. These \"inversions\" are permanently stored and can be intuitively browsed using our powerful visualization tools.</div>\r\n<div>CCM was the pre-cursor to REGGAE, patented under  8,069,188 which is a core component of the ATS Cloud Analytical Platform.  REGGAE is an innovative cellular-like data model to describe and relate complex data structures, perform distributed data analytics and find similar data based on like connections and attributes. The invention in this latest patent provides a means to easily discover behaviors and patterns among seemingly unrelated data. For example, a retail store can easily analyze its customer behaviors to determine which products are more suitable for different demographics.  There are numerous applications in healthcare, evidence discovery, threat intelligence, etc.</div>\r\n</div>','History','','inherit','open','open','','72-revision-v1','','','2014-07-21 19:17:21','2014-07-21 19:17:21','',72,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/07/21/72-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(455,3,'2014-07-21 21:26:47','2014-07-21 21:26:47','','devon-delapp','','inherit','open','open','','devon-delapp','','','2014-07-21 21:26:47','2014-07-21 21:26:47','',0,'http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/devon-delapp.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(457,3,'2014-07-21 23:17:54','2014-07-21 23:17:54','<h2>Why Applied Technical Systems?</h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-127 alignleft\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/meet-ats-image-300x216.jpg\" alt=\"meet-ats-image\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\" />\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">Applied Technical Systems Inc.

The program was formally commissioned as a Navy-wide maintenance improvement effort. Leenstra decided to settle down in Washington with his family upon retirement after 23 years of enlisted and commissioned service. Leenstra was asked by a senior NAVSEA official coordinating the ILO efforts to continue implementing the ILO effort as a contractor. Leensstra agreed and formed ATS as a means to work with the Navy to fully implement the ILO program.</p>\n[caption id=\"attachment_280\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/ADMJackWilliams_1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-280 size-thumbnail\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/ADMJackWilliams_1-150x142.jpg\" alt=\"ADMJackWilliams_1\" width=\"150\" height=\"142\" /></a> ADM Jack Williams, then Chief of Naval Material teaching COSAL[/caption]\n<h3>ATS legacy with Admiral J. G. Jack Williams, USN</h3>\n<p>Admiral Jack Williams graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946 and reported to a destroyer as Gun Boss. After completing submarine training he served on USS Pompodon (SS-486) and USS Stickelback (SS-415). He later commanded USS Sterlet (SS-392) and after nuclear power training commanded USS Haddo (SSN-604) and USS Daniel Webster (SSBN-626). After a tour as Director of Training for Naval Reactors, he assumed duties as Force Material Officer (N4) for Commander Submarine Forces, Atlantic. He then took command of Submarine Squadron 16 in Rota, Spain. Upon completion of that tour he was selected for Rear Admiral and subsequently served as Naval Attaché to the Turkish Navy. Later he commanded Submarine Group Five in San Diego. Upon promotion to Vice Admiral he served as Deputy Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet and then as Vice Chief of Naval Operations for Submarine Warfare. In 1981 he was promoted to Admiral and assigned duties as Chief of Naval Material. Admiral Williams retired from the Navy in 1983 and returned to his boyhood home in Illwaco, Washington.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In 1984 he joined ATS as a director and eventually assumed the position of Chairman of the Board, which he held until his unexpected death in 1991. During this period Admiral Williams was instrumental in creating the Naval Undersea Museum in Keyport, served as President of the Northwest Chapter of the Naval Submarine League, and was a key player in helping ATS develop configuration-based lifecycle logistics support solutions for both submarines and surface ships.\n<h3>A heritage in solving complex data problems</h3>\n<p>Several years before XML became a de facto standard, ATS realized the need for a hierarchical, self-describing, data modeling and storage technology. ATS developed the Contiguous Connection Model (CCM) technology to facilitate rapid information retrieval, enhance data navigation and visualization, and promote knowledge discovery.  This patented technology (US Patent #s 5,303,367 and 5,555,409), which was revolutionary for its time, automatically correlates hierarchical data, models it, and stores it in expandable name/value pairs.  CCM goes much furtherit creates a complete new hierarchical structure for each and every data point, with the data point as the root.

He later commanded USS Sterlet (SS-392) and after nuclear power training commanded USS Haddo (SSN-604) and USS Daniel Webster (SSBN-626). After a tour as Director of Training for Naval Reactors, he assumed duties as Force Material Officer (N4) for Commander Submarine Forces, Atlantic. He then took command of Submarine Squadron 16 in Rota, Spain. Upon completion of that tour he was selected for Rear Admiral and subsequently served as Naval Attaché to the Turkish Navy. Later he commanded Submarine Group Five in San Diego. Upon promotion to Vice Admiral he served as Deputy Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet and then as Vice Chief of Naval Operations for Submarine Warfare. In 1981 he was promoted to Admiral and assigned duties as Chief of Naval Material. Admiral Williams retired from the Navy in 1983 and returned to his boyhood home in Illwaco, Washington.</p>\r\n<p>In 1984 he joined ATS as a director and eventually assumed the position of Chairman of the Board, which he held until his unexpected death in 1991.

He later commanded USS Sterlet (SS-392) and after nuclear power training commanded USS Haddo (SSN-604) and USS Daniel Webster (SSBN-626). After a tour as Director of Training for Naval Reactors, he assumed duties as Force Material Officer (N4) for Commander Submarine Forces, Atlantic. He then took command of Submarine Squadron 16 in Rota, Spain. Upon completion of that tour he was selected for Rear Admiral and subsequently served as Naval Attaché to the Turkish Navy. Later he commanded Submarine Group Five in San Diego. Upon promotion to Vice Admiral he served as Deputy Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet and then as Vice Chief of Naval Operations for Submarine Warfare. In 1981 he was promoted to Admiral and assigned duties as Chief of Naval Material.

He later commanded USS Sterlet (SS-392) and after nuclear power training commanded USS Haddo (SSN-604) and USS Daniel Webster (SSBN-626). After a tour as Director of Training for Naval Reactors, he assumed duties as Force Material Officer (N4) for Commander Submarine Forces, Atlantic. He then took command of Submarine Squadron 16 in Rota, Spain. Upon completion of that tour he was selected for Rear Admiral and subsequently served as Naval Attaché to the Turkish Navy. Later he commanded Submarine Group Five in San Diego. Upon promotion to Vice Admiral he served as Deputy Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet and then as Vice Chief of Naval Operations for Submarine Warfare. In 1981 he was promoted to Admiral and assigned duties as Chief of Naval Material. Admiral Williams retired from the Navy in 1983 and returned to his boyhood home in Illwaco, Washington.</p>\r\n<p>In 1984 he joined ATS as a director and eventually assumed the position of Chairman of the Board, which he held until his unexpected death in 1991.

From the outset, our emphasis has been on finding ways to make the products of the Navys logistics lifecycle support system work for, rather than against, the shipboard maintenance technician.</p>\r\n<p>Most Operational Availability (Ao) and system sustainability problems experienced by the fleet today can be traced to a failure somewhere in the shore-based lifecycle logistics support system. Lack of onboard repair parts (OBRP) supply support is a particularly acute system sustainability problem, but there are also systemic problems with technical manuals, drawings, configuration and other types of engineering technical data. In many cases these technical data problems are the root cause of OBRP support problems, but they are often perceived as a Supply support problem.</p>\r\n<p>ATS uses our unique product lifecycle maintenance solutions to troubleshoot and correct lifecycle integrated logistics support and sustainability problems. Most of our Maintenance Support Group technicians are former Navy technicians who have extensive experience in the operation and maintenance of the full spectrum of shipboard systems. This maintenance-oriented perspective is fundamental to our view of the integrated logistics support world and our maintenance support analysis processes.</p>\r\n<p>We train our maintenance support technicians using our own in-house lifecycle support management training program which we developed from years of hands on experience in all facets of the integrated logistics support system. The end result is an experienced shipboard maintenance technician who is also trained to troubleshoot and repair any element of the Navys integrated logistics support system to make sure the ILS system provides our sailors with the parts, data and tools they need to restore failed systems with minimal delay.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" align=\"left\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">\r\n<h2>Maintenance &amp; Supportability Analysis</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<h2>Configuration Data Management (CDM)</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>ATS has provided preventative and corrective maintenance support solutions to its customers for over 30 years.

At ATS we offer employees the chance to work with great people, on exciting projects, with a ton of opportunity for growth.<br /> But we also recognize that ATSers have a life outside of work and need a break every once in a while. That\'s why we provide a full range of benefits for you and your eligible family members. While the benefits may vary slightly from location to location, these are the basics for full-time, U.S. employees:</p>\r\n<p><br /> <img src=\"https://www.premera.com/stellent/groups/public/documents/xcpproject/img_logo.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h3>Medical, Dental and Vision</h3>\r\n<p>Our employees are our top priority. Thats why ATS pays 100% of each employees healthcare premium. Have a family? No problem, we pay the majority of their premium, too! And with small co-pays and low deductibles, its easy to make sure you and your family are in tip-top shape.</p>\r\n<h3>401K Matching</h3>\r\n<p>We believe we should take care of our employeesnow AND in the future. We offer 100% matching on all 401K contributions up to 3% of an employees compensation and an additional 50% matching up to 5%. The maximum we will match is 4%. Its a great investment in your future and who doesnt love free money?<br /> <img class=\"media-image\" src=\"http://www.atsid.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/prudential_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"60\" /></p>\r\n<h3>Profit Sharing</h3>\r\n<p>ATS may make a profit sharing contribution at the end of the fiscal year, which will be divided between employee-elected accounts based on your compensation for the year. The employee must be employed on the last day of the fiscal year (9/30) to be eligible. Vesting starts after two years and an employee is 100% vested after five years.</p>\r\n<h3>Flexible Schedule</h3>\r\n<p>We realize not all our employees enjoy getting up before the birds and that not everyone prefers to work into the evening hours. As long as your preferred schedule meets your supervisors approval and your projects needs you can choose your own schedule.</p>\r\n<h2>Leave/Holidays</h2>\r\n<h3>Paid Time Off (PTO)</h3>\r\n<p>Most new permanent, full-time employees earn 96 hours (12 days) of Paid Time Off throughout the year, which will accrue during each pay period. If you stay with the company long enough (we think youll like us), you could earn up to 296 hours (37 days) of PTO a year!</p>\r\n<h3>Holidays</h3>\r\n<p>Our employees enjoy the flexibility of 10 floating holidays (80 hours), which can be used at any time during the year. New employees will receive prorated holiday pay based on when in the fiscal year they join us.</p>\r\n<h3>Bereavement</h3>\r\n<p>In the event of the loss of an immediate family member, we will grant permanent employees up to five working days of bereavement leave without the loss of pay.</p>\r\n<h3>Disability</h3>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Permanent employees normally scheduled to work at least 20 hours per week are eligible for disability leave accrual (paid for by ATS). Disability leave is accrued at the rate of one day per month (1/2 day for part-time employees). Up to 6 weeks of disability leave may be granted as maternity leave.

At ATS we offer employees the chance to work with great people, on exciting projects, with a ton of opportunity for growth.<br /> But we also recognize that ATSers have a life outside of work and need a break every once in a while. That\'s why we provide a full range of benefits for you and your eligible family members. While the benefits may vary slightly from location to location, these are the basics for full-time, U.S. employees:</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://www.premera.com/stellent/groups/public/documents/xcpproject/img_logo.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h3>Medical, Dental and Vision</h3>\r\n<p>Our employees are our top priority. Thats why ATS pays 100% of each employees healthcare premium. Have a family? No problem, we pay the majority of their premium, too! And with small co-pays and low deductibles, its easy to make sure you and your family are in tip-top shape.</p>\r\n<h3>401K Matching</h3>\r\n<p>We believe we should take care of our employeesnow AND in the future. We offer 100% matching on all 401K contributions up to 3% of an employees compensation and an additional 50% matching up to 5%. The maximum we will match is 4%. Its a great investment in your future and who doesnt love free money?<br /> <img class=\"media-image\" src=\"http://www.atsid.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/prudential_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"60\" /></p>\r\n<h3>Profit Sharing</h3>\r\n<p>ATS may make a profit sharing contribution at the end of the fiscal year, which will be divided between employee-elected accounts based on your compensation for the year. The employee must be employed on the last day of the fiscal year (9/30) to be eligible. Vesting starts after two years and an employee is 100% vested after five years.</p>\r\n<h3>Flexible Schedule</h3>\r\n<p>We realize not all our employees enjoy getting up before the birds and that not everyone prefers to work into the evening hours. As long as your preferred schedule meets your supervisors approval and your projects needs you can choose your own schedule.</p>\r\n<h2>Leave/Holidays</h2>\r\n<h3>Paid Time Off (PTO)</h3>\r\n<p>Most new permanent, full-time employees earn 96 hours (12 days) of Paid Time Off throughout the year, which will accrue during each pay period. If you stay with the company long enough (we think youll like us), you could earn up to 296 hours (37 days) of PTO a year!</p>\r\n<h3>Holidays</h3>\r\n<p>Our employees enjoy the flexibility of 10 floating holidays (80 hours), which can be used at any time during the year. New employees will receive prorated holiday pay based on when in the fiscal year they join us.</p>\r\n<h3>Bereavement</h3>\r\n<p>In the event of the loss of an immediate family member, we will grant permanent employees up to five working days of bereavement leave without the loss of pay.</p>\r\n<h3>Disability</h3>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;\">Permanent employees normally scheduled to work at least 20 hours per week are eligible for disability leave accrual (paid for by ATS). Disability leave is accrued at the rate of one day per month (1/2 day for part-time employees). Up to 6 weeks of disability leave may be granted as maternity leave. Up to 6 additional weeks of personal leave and/or leave without pay may be taken if desired.</span></h3>\r\n<h2><img src=\"http://www.guardianlife.com/glifepp/fragments/glic_assets_frag/images/guardian-logo.gif\" alt=\"\" /></h2>\r\n<h2>Life Insurance</h2>\r\n<p>ATS offers company-paid term life insurance for each employee at no cost to the employee in the amount of three times the basic annual salary to a maximum of $500,000.

Leenstra decided to settle down in Washington with his family upon retirement after 23 years of enlisted and commissioned service. Leenstra was asked by a senior NAVSEA official coordinating the ILO efforts to continue implementing the ILO effort as a contractor. Leensstra agreed and formed ATS as a means to work with the Navy to fully implement the ILO program.</p>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_280\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\"]<a href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/ADMJackWilliams_1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-280 size-thumbnail\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/ADMJackWilliams_1-150x142.jpg\" alt=\"ADMJackWilliams_1\" width=\"150\" height=\"142\" /></a> ADM Jack Williams, then Chief of Naval Material teaching COSAL[/caption]\r\n<h3>ATS legacy with Admiral J. G. Jack Williams, USN</h3>\r\n<p>Admiral Jack Williams graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946 and reported to a destroyer as Gun Boss. After completing submarine training he served on USS Pompodon (SS-486) and USS Stickelback (SS-415). He later commanded USS Sterlet (SS-392) and after nuclear power training commanded USS Haddo (SSN-604) and USS Daniel Webster (SSBN-626). After a tour as Director of Training for Naval Reactors, he assumed duties as Force Material Officer (N4) for Commander Submarine Forces, Atlantic. He then took command of Submarine Squadron 16 in Rota, Spain. Upon completion of that tour he was selected for Rear Admiral and subsequently served as Naval Attaché to the Turkish Navy. Later he commanded Submarine Group Five in San Diego. Upon promotion to Vice Admiral he served as Deputy Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet and then as Vice Chief of Naval Operations for Submarine Warfare. In 1981 he was promoted to Admiral and assigned duties as Chief of Naval Material. Admiral Williams retired from the Navy in 1983 and returned to his boyhood home in Illwaco, Washington.</p>\r\n<p>In 1984 he joined ATS as a director and eventually assumed the position of Chairman of the Board, which he held until his unexpected death in 1991. During this period Admiral Williams was instrumental in creating the Naval Undersea Museum in Keyport, served as President of the Northwest Chapter of the Naval Submarine League, and was a key player in helping ATS develop configuration-based lifecycle logistics support solutions for both submarines and surface ships.</p>\r\n<h3>A heritage in solving complex data problems</h3>\r\n<p>Several years before XML became a de facto standard, ATS realized the need for a hierarchical, self-describing, data modeling and storage technology. ATS developed the Contiguous Connection Model (CCM) technology to facilitate rapid information retrieval, enhance data navigation and visualization, and promote knowledge discovery.  This patented technology (US Patent #s 5,303,367 and 5,555,409), which was revolutionary for its time, automatically correlates hierarchical data, models it, and stores it in expandable name/value pairs.  CCM goes much furtherit creates a complete new hierarchical structure for each and every data point, with the data point as the root. These \"inversions\" are permanently stored and can be intuitively browsed using our powerful visualization tools.</p>\r\n<p>CCM was the pre-cursor to REGGAE, patented under  8,069,188 which is a core component of the ATS Cloud Analytical Platform.  REGGAE is an innovative cellular-like data model to describe and relate complex data structures, perform distributed data analytics and find similar data based on like connections and attributes. The invention in this latest patent provides a means to easily discover behaviors and patterns among seemingly unrelated data. For example, a retail store can easily analyze its customer behaviors to determine which products are more suitable for different demographics.  There are numerous applications in healthcare, evidence discovery, threat intelligence, etc.</p>','History','','inherit','open','open','','474-revision-v1','','','2014-08-27 17:09:14','2014-08-27 17:09:14','',474,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/08/27/474-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(574,3,'2014-08-27 17:09:14','2014-08-27 17:09:14','<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">\n\n<strong>Rick Leenstra, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</strong>\r\n\r\nSince founding ATS in 1980 upon his retirement from the US Navy, Rick has applied his extensive experience with configuration-based life cycle maintenance support systems for Naval ships and systems to the development of ATS\' technology and service offerings.  Rick is the co-inventor of ATS\' patented CCM technology.

ATS is the first company that can show technical data errors between relevant engineering, maintenance and logistics data and provide its customers with a maintenance sustainment solution that corrects the issues that reduce Operational Availability (Ao).</p>\r\n<p>The sole function of lifecycle logistics support products is to facilitate efficient and effective execution of system maintenance functions. Consequently, the only way to truly measure the effectiveness of these products (and the processes behind them) is to analyze actual system failures to see how well the logistics support system supported the maintenance action. Failure analysis goes beyond looking at CASREP data. In order to get a true picture of whats failing, logistics support analysts need to take a close look at all maintenance actions to determine exactly what failed, what logistics support was required to restore the system, and whether or not that support was readily identifiable and available to the system technician. Too often there are serious problems with maintenance support, particularly onboard repair parts, but the root cause of these problems is seldom evident to shipboard techniciansthey just learn to live with them. Our technicians, however, are specially trained to troubleshoot and fix these logistics support system problems in much the same way as shipboard technicians are trained to troubleshoot and fix shipboard system problems.</p>\r\n<p>Most onboard logistics support problems can be traced to technical data problems. The lack of integration between engineering, maintenance and logistics support data is a well-known and continuing problem for the Navy. The data that defines the Configuration Items (CI) that collectively constitute ship systems and the seemingly endless array of Technical Information (TI) that define or drive life cycle support requirements for these CI are extremely complex and dynamic. Unfortunately, this interdependent data is typically maintained in disparate data bases with little if any life cycle interaction. Consequently, engineering data soon gets out of sync with maintenance data and the various elements of logistics get out of sync with both engineering and maintenance dataand all get out of sync with the actual system configuration. This lack of data integration and effort creates serious logistics support problems for the fleet, which of course reduces operational readiness. Finding and fixing the root cause of these problems is what ATS does best.</p>\r\n<p>For over 30 years ATS has been dealing with this systemic data integration problemfrom the deck-plate to the SYSCOM level. One of the most important lessons we learned from this experience is the fact that the only true definition of a particular system configuration is the system itself. Moreover, without this solid configuration foundation any attempt to analyze the viability of logistics support is an exercise in futility. Consequently, we begin our analysis by establishing a top-down Configuration Item (CI) breakdown of the system, including a hand-over-hand site sight validation if necessary. We then ingest and link any and all relevant engineering, maintenance and logistics support Technical Information (TI) to these CIwhich of course are the things that fail.</p>\r\n<p>We do this using a unique data correlation system that allows us to integrate this data through a common configuration structure. We call this system MSATMaintenance Supportability Analysis Tool. MSAT has the capability to ingest any type of engineering, maintenance and logistics support data down to the piece part level, and to automatically create and maintain all relevant connections between this data. MSAT also provides the means to automatically show where data disconnects exist and where these disconnects are creating or contributing to deck plate logistics support problems.

MSAT has the capability to ingest any type of engineering, maintenance and logistics support data down to the piece part level in order to automatically expose and eliminate the data disconnects that create or contribute to deck plate logistics support problems. <a title=\"MSAT\" href=\"http://dev.atsid.com/products/msat-explained/\">Learn more about MSAT</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The sole function of an integrated logistics support solution is to facilitate efficient and effective execution of system maintenance functions. The only way to truly measure the effectiveness of these products (and the processes behind them) is to analyze actual system failures to see how well the logistics support system supported the maintenance action. To do this, logistics support analysts need to take a close look at all maintenance actions to determine exactly what failed, what logistics support was required to restore the system, and whether or not that support was readily identifiable and available to the system technician. Finding and fixing the root cause of these problems is what ATS does best.</p>\r\n<p>ATS can help you outline a sustainment strategy/plan to deliver increased readiness and availability.<strong> <a href=\"http://atsid.com/contact-us?interest=msat-demo\">Contact ATS</a> </strong>today to learn more about our in-depth Maintenance and Readiness Support Services.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3> </h3>','Maintenance and Supportability Analysis','','inherit','open','open','','260-revision-v1','','','2014-09-16 22:04:02','2014-09-16 22:04:02','',260,'http://dev.atsid.com/2014/09/16/260-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(607,3,'2014-09-16 22:58:13','2014-09-16 22:58:13','<aside class=\"alignright\">\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_342\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"213\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-342\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/qualityassurance-1.jpg\" alt=\"Quality Assurance\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /> Quality Assurance[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_343\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"213\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-343\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/swe-1.jpg\" alt=\"Collaborative Development\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /> Collaborative Development[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_344\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"213\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-344\" src=\"http://dev.atsid.com/wp-content/uploads/whiteboard2-1.jpg\" alt=\"Continuous Engineering\" width=\"213\" height=\"142\" /> Continuous Engineering[/caption]\r\n\r\n</aside>\r\n<h3>Agile Software Development - experts in data</h3>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\">ATS is a top software development company that specializes in agile software development.

The end result is an experienced shipboard maintenance technician who is also trained to troubleshoot and repair any element of the Navys integrated logistics support system to make sure the ILS system provides our sailors with the parts, data and tools they need to restore failed systems with minimal delay.</p>\r\n<h3>Maintenance &amp; Supportability Analysis</h3>\r\n<p>ATS has provided preventative and corrective maintenance support solutions to its customers for over 30 years.
